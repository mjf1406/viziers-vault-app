Due to performance constraints of computers, we have to use 24-mile hexes for the world map. 
## Earth-sized Planets

If the party wants to create Earth-sized planets because Earth's circumference is 24,901 miles.

If we used 3-miles hexes, the 2D world would be ~8,300 hexes wide.
$$\frac{24{,}901}{3} = 8{,}300.33 \text{ hexes}$$
If we use 24-mile hexes, the 2D world would be ~1,037 hexes wide.
$$\frac{24{,}901}{24} = 1{,}037.54 \text{ hexes}$$
We still have a problem because the canvas on the web can only handle about 150 hexes wide before it starts to lag.
## Jupiter-sized Planets

Let's talk about gas giants now. We'll use Jupiter's circumference of 292,946 miles.

If we used 3-miles hexes, the 2D world would be ~97,648 hexes wide.
$$\frac{292{,}946}{3} = 97{,}648.66 \text{ hexes}$$
If we use 24-mile hexes, the 2D world would be ~12,206 hexes wide.
$$\frac{292{,}946}{24} = 12{,}206.08 \text{ hexes}$$
