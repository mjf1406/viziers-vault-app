    "Deep footprints of a booted, humanoid are visible in the fresh snow. The footsteps lead deep into a cave; they do not return.",
    "The large, clawed footprints of a four legged beast are clearly visible in the snow. Canny PCs can estimate the size of the beast that made them.",
    "The still air is fiercely cold. Ice crystals form on and around the PCs’ noses and mouths as well as in their eyebrows. It is so cold here, it takes the PCs’ breath away.",
    "A faint mist covers the ground to ankle depth. The mist does not overly obscure vision. Perceptive PCs notice the mist seems to be issuing from somewhere deep in the ground.",
    "A faint shadow in the ice alerts the PCs to something vaguely man-sized entombed in the frozen ground. If the PCs dig down, they discovered the frozen, disembowelled body of a human. (Hacking and digging and pick axeing down takes several minutes and makes a fair bit of noise, which might alert nearby residents).",
    "Great gouge marks in the snow and ice show where something large and powerful has scrapped and torn at the ground.",
    "A single ten-foot wide ice pillar sprouts from the ground, linking it to the boughs of the nearby trees, high above. The ice is opaque and incredibly hard.",
    "A pool of water once lay here, but it has long since frozen creating a patch of incredibly slippery terrain. The ice is slightly opaque and within the PCs can see the indistinct entombed forms of several creatures. The ice is thick and easily supports the party’s weight.",
    "A large snowdrift fills this area. Higher than a man is tall, the snowdrift serves as a creature's larder—the frozen corpses of several creatures lie inside awaiting the creature's attentions.",
    "A slab of rock juts up from the frozen ground, providing cover from what lies beyond. Deep gouges mar the rock’s surface.",
    "The party comes across a small village brimming with laughter as they pass through town several small children assault them with snowballs laughing and running for cover.",
    "The party wakes up and looks out the windows of the inn and is greeted by a thick, white blanket of snow coating the whole village. They see residents at every door and window, slack-jawed and staring apprehensively at the snowdrifts. After all, this is a tropical island...",
    "There is a very large frozen lake that appears to have a colossal aberration frozen under the surface.",
    "A small cult of Yuan-Ti have gathered around a local volcano and worshiping the heat it brings in this frigid environment.",
    "A large dome made of ice is in the middle of the tundra. Inside is a town that is being quarantined by a silver dragon.",
    "A bheur hag is putting people to sleep with magic, and then takes their clothes to make them have frostbite",
    "Snowflakes start falling. Only they are three to four feet across and a quarter inch thick... what could be causing such unusual snowfall ?",
    "A storm blows up quickly and the party must immediately seek shelter. It is bitterly cold, with a howling wind and blinding snow. In the distance can be heard the booming laughter of Frost Giants at play.",
    "Snow blows hard against your faces, you clutch your cloaks closely cursing the gods for such blistering cold. Out of the thick snowfall a figure in a plaid flannel coat walks up to you and says \"Lovely day eh? Feels like spring's finally comin' aboot\"",
    "Ice falls from a cliff face or tree and shatters the ground the party is standing on, sending them sliding down into the deep. Eventually it dumps them into a brilliantly sparkling and beautiful (but deadly) underground ice kingdom ruled by an Ice Dragon, who has a task she needs done (that the party is particularly suited for). They can help and be released with their lives and a boon each, or refuse and be forever encased in ice below the earth.",
    "The party is walking through a light snowfall when they come across a small clearing that appears to be in full summer. The air is warm, flowers are blooming, and the snow has become a light drizzle. There are even insects and butterflies living within this mysterious 20 foot radius circle.",
    "A fresh snow has fallen and the party is only a mile or so outside the next village. Without warning an earthquake large enough to knock some to their feet occurs. The road buckles and splits and after about a minute the quake subsides. The village, while suffering no casualties is heavily damaged. A lot of their homes were rendered unlivable for the winter, and much of their livestock escaped in the chaos.",
    "The party stumbles upon a small camp of travelers. They, and their equipment are all frozen solid. Upon closer examination even the fire in the campfire had turned to ice.",
    "An avalanche has very recently buried a small village. The three survivors huddle together in a makeshift shelter in a last ditch effort to survive the cold.",
    "A small amount of steam rises from a nearby cave during a blizzard, marking it as a potential safe haven from the storm. A natural hot spring bubbles inside with bright blue, opaque water. The water is hot, but not uncomfortable is one were to enter. At the bottom of the pool is a brood of lizardfolk, who submerged themselves when the party entered.",
    "The party finds a grave sized hole cut into the ice of a frozen lake. It is empty. Not far away is an outpost. Inside the outpost is a grizzly scene of death and murder. Miners, surveying the area for potential gold mines seem to have all killed one another in horrific ways. The lone survivor is a dog. A husky trotting around the outside of the building. The dog is a Changeling. It's natural shape is some strange aberration of flesh and tentacles.",
    "The party is ambushed in an open field of snow by a large amount of orcs. Too many orcs for the party to handle on their own, it would seem. As luck would have it, some of the orcs fall into the ground evening the odds. The party now realizes they are on a frozen lake and must battle the orcs, and the cracking ice at the same time.",
    "A covered wagon is stopped in the road. It's canvas top is torn and flaps in the wind. Discarded gear, splashes of blood, two dead bodies, and half a dozen sets of footprints litter the area. A small boy is hiding under the wagon with a dagger. The wagon was attacked by yetis and the adults chased to finish them off. By the looks of it it has been some time and they are likely not coming back.",
    "Booming voices can be heard in a heated argument from within the forest. Two Hill Giants are building a giant snowman and are arguing about whether or not the bottom or the top is supposed to be bigger.",
    "Just after leaving the forest/village edge, (1d10+4) mounds of snow quickly rise up from the ground, surrounding the party. The mounds are approximately four feet high, with a diameter of around two feet. Each mound has what appear to be eyes that glow brilliantly, with each mound having a different color (or slowly shifting colors). Roll a (1d3). On a 1, the mounds attack. On a 2-3, the mound directly in front of the party speaks in a harsh, but ethereal voice. It asks for the party's assistance in ridding their land of an ancient evil that has returned.",
    "CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Sounds like small explosions go off in the middle of the night. Should the PCs investigate, they will find trees sundered around the forest. A simple Investigation check will show that the pattern of sundered wood indicates that they exploded from the inside! A high enough Nature check will remind the players that trees are full of liquid sap that sometimes flash-freezes, expanding suddenly and causing this phenomenon.",
    "As the party is relaxing in a village/tavern, a couple in furs approach and ask if the party would be willing to retrieve a malumkalt for 1000 gold. This apple-like fruit only grows on the oldest tree in a forest, and ripens during the winter solstice. Payment will be received upon delivery. The winter solstice is three days away, and the fruit will rot within five days of plucking.",
    "Trudging through the snow, a large cave is spotted about a half a mile from the party. Once spotted, a large gust of wind precedes a heavy snowfall. Investigating the cave will reveal a still warm, but extinguished fire about 50 feet inside the cave. By the firepit, there are 2 knapsacks, 3 bedrolls, a cooking pot containing a recently cooked meal (enough for the whole party), and a silver flute adorned with sapphires. Knapsack #1 has (1d6) scrolls, (1d6) dried rations, and a map to a treasure supposedly found in this cave. Knapsack #2 has (1d6) fresh rations, 3 gems, and a magical golden ring with properties that must be discovered. Upon closer inspection, there are footprints that lead to marks 10 feet further in the cave indicating that bodies were dragged deeper into its bowels. The victims may still be alive. The treasure has yet to be claimed, and it is most likely magical in nature.",
    "Dead beast found in the snow after a blizzard that appears to have been killed and cut open. Upon closer inspection, a person is found inside!",
    "The party are searching the graveyard of an abandoned chapel for a particular grave when snow starts falling. It soon becomes quite heavy. One of them notices that the snow isn't settling on one of the graves. The earth is too warm?",
    'Stumbling through the thick snowstorm into a clearing in the wooded area, you are stunned to see a hut in the center of the glade, standing proud atop a pair of chicken legs... "In come in from the cold CiChee (Russian for Children)... Is cold as death there come in..." The old lady, crooked with years smiles from the doorway and waves at you to come inside, her shawl catching in a wind... Fae are tricksy spirits. One has chosen to follow your group through the snow and slush post storm. It finds great fun in building Snowman after Snowman in your wake. To your eye it seems as if the snowmen are generating when you aren\'t looking and following you....',
    "A gigantic glacier breaks, not close enough to injure the players, but what they see is a horror. The ice is pure and crystal clear, encased within is a titan of the ancient world... frozen in anger.",
    "The party begins to hear screaming of a deranged beast in the snowy forest. Upon investigation a large green haired beast, akin to a wereboar, is yelling at a distant village. He is hell bent on ruining the lives of its citizens and will attempt to persuade the party into a clever scheme to rob them all.",
    "Snowflakes begin to fall gently from the night sky. As they drift down and land on your cloaks, packs, and hair, they hiss softy. Where they touch skin and melt, the hiss burns and you quickly realize they are acidic. You need to find shelter and quickly.",
    "The snow crunches noisily under your bootsteps, getting louder with each progressive pace. A close check shows that mixed in with the snow and ice is chunky ground glass and shards of broken white pottery which has been shredding your leather boots and pants legs.",
    "The merry jingle of bells approaches and a sleigh appears. Roll a D4. On a 4, the sleigh is red and gold, drawn by a team of festooned reindeer, and the driver is a jolly fat man with a large sack of mildly magical goods. On a 3, the sleigh is drawn by a pack of dogs and the fur-wrapped driver is slumped over as though dead. As the sled whizzes by, a crate falls off the back, but the sled does not stop. The crate is full of health potions and bears the label: “Gnome Hospital. Urgent delivery!” On a 2, the sleigh is empty and drawn by a pair of frightened, wild-eyed horses. On a 1, the sleigh is silver and white, drawn by albino reindeer, and driven by a duergar. The passenger is a tall, pale woman who offers any humans in the party Turkish delight and promises them a vast kingdom should they slay a certain magical lion for her.",
    "A halfling dressed in warm furs runs pass giggling insanely holding aloft what looks like a ring adorned with red/orange gems.",
    "A few moments later a slender young woman stumbles after him. She is dressed in incredibly high quality silks but bearly enough of it for decency let alone warmth. She has goosebumps an her skin is turning almost blue. She tells after the halfling \"Bring it back. It isn't funny! I'll freeze.\"",
    "There's a hole in the ice, and a backpack nearby. It looks like someone was fishing... did they fall in, or did something snatch them beneath the water?",
    "Somewhere in the world, a magical pool of water evaporates into the clouds. When this magic water vapor comes down as sleet/ snow/ freezing rain, it forms icicles on the branches of trees or edges of rooftops. These enchanted icicles have a semblance of life to them. Use the stats for piercers from the Monster Manual... just reskin them as inflicting cold damage. Could make exploring that forest much more “interesting”.",
    "A Snow-Bow. The sunlight reflects off the glazed surface of snow causing a rainbow. Possibly a double Snow-Bow … or even the ultra-rare, Triple Snow-Bow.",
    "The party arrives at a lone barn with a cart in good condition found outside. Inside the barn are two monks, a St. Bernard, and a donkey. (Depending on time, they are either making preparations to continue their travel, taking a short break from their travel, or stopping to rest for the night)",
    "As your party prepares camp, one of the players finds the horizion engulfed by a raging blizzard. The storm rages towards them and your players only have minutes to find or make shelter.",
    "Walking over the frozen landscape a deep glacier crack opens up and swallows one or more players. How will they get up?",
    "The open field is covered with waist high snow. As the players vade through it they suddenly find the snow around them trampled and smooth, similar to earthen floor. They soon discover that they're standing in a huge footmark left by a dragon/wyvern that recently pounced on a pray. The two clawed feet along with its immense wings is what has marked the ground around them.",
    "During the night a cold freezing wind sweeps over the land, turning the landscape white with frost. As dawn rises a black pillar of smoke appears against he frigidity horizon. It's hard to make out the pillar behind the freezing mist that covers the air. Later the party meets a family struggling against the cold wind. Their house was burnt to the ground by raiding trolls. They lost everything and is now hoping that a neighboring farm will shelter them during the winter. They are desperate and will reluctantly part with a family heirloom for some coin. - Roll once on a minor magical items table.",
    "The winter takes on a unnatural cold. Everything freezes, all the parties food and water. It's nearly impossible to make a fire it's d. The players skin is covered with frost. Their cloth do next to nothing to keep them warm. They must all make appropriate survival and/or CON checks or suffer gangrene damage.",
    "You come upon a recent battle. A merchant's snow cart lies in its center. Several bodies of the merchants family and hired guards is sprawled around it, all covered with deep cuts. A cold chill rolls down the players spine as they see how the blood stained snow rises upwards, like a reversed snowfall, only to gather into a crimson slowly growing sphere. A tracking check will reveal that there is no tracks or evidence of any physical assailants.",

    "You realize, at some point in your revelry, you wound up the proud owner of a pumpkin farm somewhere in the countryside. Most of the gold you had on hand is gone, replaced with a crinkled roll of parchment recording the transfer of title.",
    "You wake up with 500 platinum and a warrant with your picture, but the name says, ‘Unknown thief 3 of 5’. Four other unknown thieves have their portraits hanging in the tavern.",
    "You wake up to the sound of a trumpet. All around you are dwarves in different states of nakedness and everyone has an instrument. Seems like you joined the Orchester.",
    "Someone yells at you to wake up, it seems you challenged a Guard to a duel at noon, you have 15 Minutes left, and you’re still drunk.",

    "You wake up in the local mages library having apparently drunkenly solved a complex magical mystery.",
    "You wake up in a jail cell from a kick in your ribs. The world is fuzzy, your head is pounding, and a large guard squats over you and whispers ‘So you like other people’s wives do ya?’",
    "You wake up half in a ditch of stinking greenish water. Something is crawling up your leg inside of your clothes then it bites your inner thigh…",
    "You wake up in a tavern bedroom in a cozy feather bed. All of your possessions are there and you seem to have gained 354 extra gold pieces and a note that says ‘Thanks, you were fabulous.’",
    "While out partying, you broke something expensive, but a local noble you were out with got caught with the blame and the bill. They plan to get payback one way or another.",

    "You committed an act of public indecency while trying to retrieve a ferret from your trousers.",
    "You invested all your gold in a local loser’s get-rich-quick scheme. It’s actually not a bad plan, but he has his shirt on backwards and he’s perfectly sober.",

    "You have three new tattoos, one of them is in a place that never sees sunlight. What are the new tattoos?",
    "You find a wedding ring (worth 1d10x1d100 gp) on your finger. An inventory of your coin-purse may or may not reveal that you paid for the ring somehow. The inscription is your name plus the name of someone you don’t know. Even after you take off the ring, you may or may not notice shadowy people following you.",
    "You wake up with a terrible headache, and are inside a closed casket turned upside down in an abandoned warehouse. A note that reads, ‘Be more careful next time’ may or may not be stuffed in your shirt pocket, and you may or may not know who signed it and put it there.",
    "The webs of your fingers and toes have been stitched together with either artful, elegant, and tiny stitches, or crudely glued together with magical glue. Has your mouth suffered the same fate?",
    "Your pants are on your arms and over your head, and your shirt is on your legs. Your socks and boots are laced up on your hands and a stuffed horse’s head is crudely attached by string onto your underwear (and backside). Something unspeakable and foul is inside the stuffed head.",
    "Your mouth tastes like the sole of your boot; then you realize your boot has been stuffed in your mouth while you sleep. A dog dropping wrapped in a lovely pink silken bow has been artfully deposited inside.",

After a while, you’re fined 2d20gp and released if you pay, if not, you’re left in the pillory for 1d4 hours, or until someone else pays. Lose 1d6+1 hp.",
    "You wake up covered in blood, scrapes, cuts, and with a wobbly tooth. Your companions tell you that you stumbled in late last night yelling ‘You should have seen the other guy!’. Examination of your belongings reveals you are now 100GP richer. It seems you may have gotten into a fight with, or possibly mugged, somebody quite well off. There’s a heavy knock on the tavern door, and you can see guards outside.",
    "You awaken with an entire small tavern’s worth of people crammed into your bed in various states of undress. You’re sticky with spilled beer, somebody has drawn a huge moustache on your face in soot, and you have a horrible feeling that one of your new friends missed the chamber pot in the middle of the night. There is vomit in your left boot, and the right is missing entirely.",
    "You’re beaten awake by a twig broom. Looks like you made somebody else’s front room your bed for the night. The floor is piled with turnips, which you seem to have collected – your shirt is several feet away and stuffed full of the things. The house owner picks a turnip up, throws it at your head, and yells at you to get out.",
    "Several hundred rats surround your bed, staring unblinkingly at you. They will follow you, and obey simple commands, but only until sundown, when they disappear back into cracks and pipes and alleyways.",
    "You’re shackled to an oar in a galley.",

    "When you stagger downstairs into the tavern, a burly female half-orc grabs you and throws you down into a seat. Apparently you won an arm-wrestling contest against her last night, and she wants a rematch.",
    "You don’t remember any of your exploits last night, but the town bards apparently do. Worse, the song one of them wrote about you has become a comic hit and is being sung in every tavern in town within the week. Every time you hear the song, the details get wilder and wilder. You have no idea which of them are true.",
    "Somebody has shaved off all your hair. A quick check around your body reveals that, yes, they shaved all of your hair.",
    "When you go downstairs, all the residents of the tavern greet you with shouts and open arms. Seems that you jumped up on the bar last night and proclaimed ‘drinks are on me!’. You’re now quite a lot poorer.",
    "An angry innkeeper is demanding payment for an entire barrel of ale. Seems you got tired of your drinking horn, and decided to go straight to the source. That would explain why your clothes are completely soaked and stinking of stale beer.",
    "You bought a horse. She’s on her last legs, knock-kneed, toothless, swaybacked, and bad-tempered. She takes an instant dislike to you.",
    "You’re woken by jostling. When you open your eyes, you’re on a sedan chair being carried through a cheering crowd. Around your neck is a gold chain. In the distance you can see a stage with a table, and on the table is a feast. You’re now mayor of the town. It’s a pity that the town has a tradition of sacrificing its mayor after a year in office to placate the monsters that live beneath.",
    "You wake up face down on the street, just outside where you are staying. You don’t know how long you’ve been sleeping on your arms but both of them have gone to sleep entirely and you cannot manipulate either, only swing them limply.",

    "Two tiny armies form ranks in the sand and march into battle: one of red crabs climbing from the sea, another of white crabs from the dunegrass up inland. Even a few crabs are no threat to a human, but enough of them might be. If you ignore them they’ll go about their violent business and eventually one side will emerge victorious. If you aid one side against the other, the victors will reward you with cached spoils. Mostly tide-washed junk, but a handful of lost treasures as well. If you attack both sides they’ll band together to fight you.",
    "Mud slurries obscenely here. A water elemental and an earth elemental in a forbidden tryst. They’ll offer a modest bribe to get you to forget what you’ve seen, but plot sudden, stalking violence if you try to haggle or refuse. Don’t trust sand or saltwater after you’ve provoked them.",

    "Some patches of sand here are sunken and pitted with bubbles. Giant, carnivorous clams lurk beneath these. Watch your step, or you might lose a foot to their clamping shells.",
    "A whale, wide-eyed with terror, beaches itself before you. It won’t be long now til it dies. The whale’s pursuer waits in the shallows offshore, waves beating at its fins and spines. If the whale is not returned to the water, it will drag its glistening bulk ashore to retrieve it.",
    "A mass of imperishable plastic waste from a gone and forgotten civilization. Maybe worth something to a collector of curiousities or an alchemist.",

They’ll pay for prisoners, as well as tips about vulnerable populations, but may try to capture you if you give an impression of weakness. If released the slaves on the galley will split evenly between those who flee and those who try to kill the crew.",

    "You spot something shiny ahead: the handle of a sword jutting up from the sand. There’s not much left beneath that hasn’t rusted to powder. Inscribed on the blade is part of a poem in a language only scholars still speak, florid in its dedication of the sword to a young prince by their father, the king. The sword’s enchantment is as broken as its blade. Where once its cut carried golden light that ate away at wounds, it now inflicts a contagious, blistering radiance.",

Not much time’s left before the mob arrives.",

    "A rusted machine. Its gears turn so slowly that the movement is nearly imperceptible, its ticking seeming perhaps to be your imagination. It will finally wind down in a matter of hours, and when it does it will explode. With tools (or fingers you don’t mind getting pinched off) the gears can be manually re- or unwound. Immersing the machine in water will delay its detonation indefinitely.",

They work to separate the abominable in-betweens of land and sea: amphibians, sailors, seagulls, and so on, with the edge of their scissors if necessary (it’s most often necessary). The kelp-freits try to set up flanks between themselves, so they can combine their scissors to gruesome amputative effect.",

The enchantment on it is rather crude, so a mask painted to look like it, its reflection in a mirror, and the like would all be sufficient to fool the face into opening. Dynamite will also open the face, but risks damaging the treasure within.",

    "A collection of jars, some shattered, some whole, all caught in some muck. Within them is some goo. Drinking the goo inflicts a piscine mutation: gills, bulging eyes, legs fused into fins, skin turned to scales, and so on. Each jar’s goo inflicts a single mutation.",
    "An estuary where crocodiles lurk.",
    "A basket bobbing in the sea foam. Within is a wailing baby, several items of golden jewelry, and a note. The note explains that the baby is the youngest son of a king, sent downriver to escape the murderous attention of the crown prince. It further implores its reader to raise the baby well, take the jewelry as payment (though leaving one piece as a keepsake), and some day tell them of their royal heritage and duty to overthrow their tyrannous sibling.",
    "An impromptu bazaar halfway in the water. Merchants from land and sea have gathered here to trade goods only found in their respective environs.",

    "A floating dock that trails out to a prime fishing spot.",

Curious about you, but unable to speak your language, and assume their gesticulations are more comprehensible than they are. At the first sign of violence they’ll vomit their guts out and crawl over each other to get back in the ocean.",

    "Gems ground to dust have been mixed into the sand here, glittering in ruby and sapphire hues. It’d be valuable but time consuming to sift it out here, but this risks attracting the attention of wandering monsters. The mixed sand could be packed up to be sifted elsewhere, but the ratio of sand-to-gem-dust could make it prohibitively heavy.",
    "A lifelike, gently smiling statue carved from salt, up to its knees in the sand. Those within the statue’s field of view (if its eyes could see) receive a penalty to their ability to resist outside influences on their mind.",

    "Goblins training gulls to shit in peoples’ eyes.",
    "A red tide laps at the shore. It’s infested with vampiric, symbiotic algae. A gaggle of infested people (evident by their crimson eyes and veins) are bathing in the stuff. They try to ply you with drugs and good company to offer up some blood (any sort will do), and become increasingly agitated if you do not. Their preferred mode of attack is to spike the dose of whatever they can get you to take with a sedative and drain you while you’re passed out.",
    "A sea turtle nesting site. You’ve arrived at just the right time to see the mass hatching. Predators will be gathering soon to pick off the baby turtles before they reach the water. Maybe you’ll be joining them.",
    "A sudden fog rolls in. Vague lights can be seen through it. Lanterns? Will-o’-wisps? Lures? Perhaps it’s better to avoid them than investigate.",
    "A burial at sea. Mourners place treasures on the boat of their chief, then set it ablaze. It’ll sink some distance out. Polite observers will be invited to join the festivities to follow.",
    "An execution. The offender is being buried up to their head below the high tide line. Someone in the gathered crowd is being held back, screaming that the one being buried has been falsely charged. By law they’ve got until the tide comes in to prove it.",

    "A nuckalavee charges from the surf. A tireless pursuer, but can’t cross freshwater.",
    "A resplendent coconut palm held sacred by local people. They know, but don’t speak openly of, a ritual by which you can remove an evil presence from someone’s mind (possession, madness, domination, enchantment, etc.) by trepanning them, drilling to the core of a coconut from the sacred palm, and placing the holes together to draw the evil presence from their head and into the coconut. Trees grown from coconuts used in the ritual are twisted things, bearing the mark of the evil they contained.",
    "A group clad in immaculate white robes, browbeating some reluctant few members into following them willingly into the ocean. Apparently a suicide cult. Non-members are proselytized to, and asked not to interfere.",

He’s not hostile and is pinned in place by the surrounding walls as he was chasing dinner down a hole and has wiggled himself into this tunnel, blocking any forward movement. If the party attacks him, he will yell and cry, ‘Stop it, please!’ and be overly pathetic, but with his arms pinned at his sides, they will likely kill him in time (suggest higher hit points than normal so the party has to take their time). If they chat with him, he knows a bit about the surrounding rooms as he’s seen creatures moving through the halls and possibly former adventurers. His name is Gordum, and he’s really hungry as he hasn’t eaten in a very long time. Normally, adventurers take pity on him and feed him while they make their way through the dungeon, but the real reason he stays stuck here is a ring of sustenance that he found years ago and pull on ’cause it was shiny.’ If he’s friendly, he offers to watch over the party while they sleep and promises to warn them if anyone else comes down the hallway.",

The water is chilled and safe, even if it tastes earthy and heavy with minerals. As the group moves into the cave, they likely notice coins littering the edges of the room in small piles and an outcropping halfway up on the east wall… with a snoring, smoking dragon’s head. If the party is quiet, they can sneak through, but any attacks or loud noise wake and do not harm the dragon. It lets out a massive burst of fire over the heads of the group and yells curses as it waves around. Once it finishes, it demands tribute from the group or it will eat them!! In reality, the head and neck are a permanent illusion that was placed in the area to scare off adventurers by a mage who was practicing some new defenses for his study, and a fairy dragon has worked out how to control the illusion and get it to move when he wants. He uses magic to project his voice and sound like a great dragon, and can use a rune placed as part of the illusion to fire a cone of fire 3 times a day that does damage as an ancient dragon. The Fairy Dragon living in a small opening that’s only accessible at the top of the dome ceiling with a meter (2.5 foot) opening that one would need to fly to or us other means. Any tribute that’s left is floated to his home when the adventurers move on and kept there, or discarded around the ground to add to his greatness. (If characters can get to his cave, he should have 2-3 magical items of some note). The little guy has really done well duping people over the years.",

If there’s no light, the ruby isn’t found. The light through the ruby displaces words in 5-6 directions saying ‘The Stone of Anolox.’ A group also notices a warning on the wall, one painted with blood and another carved with what must be someone’s finger nails saying – ‘Do not, by any means, touch that gem!’ Anyone who picks up the gem, well, except Anolox, is immediately disintegrated and their ash fills the tunnel.",

Every time the party moves past the skeletons, they point a different direction, and it changes every time.",

One looks like a prince leaning in to kiss a sleeping princess, another is a goblin throwing its hands in the air in panic, and another a cautious knight stalking in his armor.

    "Help us Heroes! – The group comes across an small village that spreads out in a crevace in the wall and stretches for hundreds of feet, but where the ceiling is never more than 4 feet high. This is a village of Myconids that have lived here peacefully ‘since the time of our first spores’ and numbers in the thousands. They beg the party to help them as there is a murdered in the midst. Every day, more and more of their people go missing, and they can’t find the culprit. If they are helped, they will give the party pearls that they collect from nearby shellfish and have saved for years. (The murderer is a kobold with a ring of invisibility and a strange mask to keep from falling to the creatures spores. He REALLY loves cooked mushrooms and has been harvesting the myconids for dinner since finding the village).",
    "Welcome Matt – The group comes to a door rigged with a number of traps. A line at the top that pulls something above the door if it’s opened, a pressure plate that’s released from the bottom if the door is opened, poison darts that fire from the wall behind it, the works! All the traps are fairly easy to spot and disarm, and there are 6 total. An exceeding high perception check is needed to hear that there’s a small click after each trap is set off or disarmed. Once all six have been triggered, the real trap occurs. The walls 30 feet to either side of the door slam into the ceiling (these are 10ft cubes). At the same time, the floor drops out under the door at a steep angle to a smooth shoot, and the walls start moving in. While it looked like there was something behind the door, it leads no where but a series of mirrors that look like a nearly endless hallway, and with the walls closing in, the only way is down. Those characters that do slide down are eventually deposited into a large cage where a robed figure covered in bandages whips around and screams, ‘Happy Birthday Matt!’ He’s then disappointed that you and yours are not Matt. After muttering to himself for a while, he eventually apologizes for the ‘trap’ and releases the group, showing them to a set of stairs that head back to the tunnel. They don’t run into this encounter again.",

Stepping on a trap in the middle of the open room causes the door to shut and the ceiling to begin to collapse – but only as long as one member of the party is still in the first hallway. That party member can disarm the trap, opening the door and raising the ceiling by finding a recess on the wall in the hallway with a switch in it. If they fail a roll on the first attempt they only manage to stick their hand through a hole into the room and have to search for a second recess.",

It contains a bunch of spell books for the wizards in your party, some defensive magical items, a moderate stash of gold, and a heap of baubles and nearly insignificant magical items.",
    "An undead, but coherrent, merchant runs a small item shop in the depths of the dungeon. The shopkeep is a little mad, but seems content to run a shop with average or slightly below average prices on basic goods (maybe a few rarities at DM’s discretion.) The Merchant seems disinterested in the world beyond the room their shop is located in, and if pressed seems to think they’re getting new supplies in once a week. Will react accordingly if the PCs attempt to cheat or steal from them.",
    "An archway has been heavily barricaded and the area around it has sign postings in the language of the dungeon’s inhabitants with stern warning to stay away. Skittering can be heard from within. Inside is a wing of the dungeon containing a burrow having broken through the wall and an infestation of subterranean creatures of the DM’s choice. (Possibly of a high CR to make this optional wing and its loot a real challenge to the PCs)",
    "A patch of wall indiscernible from the rest of the dungeon except for the incredibly soft quality of the stone. A small alcove containing a slightly inhuman skeleton is on the other side.",
    "A room that has no gravity.",
    "A crack in the floor that constantly streams out a thin wisp of smoke. It smells of honey.",
    "A docile monster that is permanently invisible.",
    "A room with a large central pool in which an elemental lives, protecting a powerful artifact.",
    "The ghost of an adventurer that became lost in the dungeon years ago.",
    "Foolish forebears- Ghosts of an adventuring party that died there long ago. They re-enact the the moments leading up to their deaths with no notice of the players. They can help lead them through the dungeon, and even offer information the players don’t know. Eventually though they will lead the party into a trap or deadly encounter",
    "Nuka skeletons- A room with the charred skeletons of dead adventurers. The walls are burnt black with the only thing juxtaposing it being the perfect white silhouettes of their final moments. When the player’s backs are turned the silhouettes move, and begin attacking the players. The skeletons get up, and their burnt black bones come alive with fiery cracks not dissimilar to embers left in the bottom of a bonfire.",
    "Murder mystery spectacular-A doorway that leads into a well set dining room has an instant kill trap thst extracts people’s souls from their bodies. They now have to act as ghosts in a murder mystery dinner party, and can get back in their bodies once they have helped solve the mystery. They are unable to communicate with anyone directly, but they can ‘haunt’ things to send messages.",
    "Arachnid ally-A spider living in an old shoe offers information to adventurers for a modest fee. She can offer shortcuts, intel, and hidden passages",
    "Pilfering party-Another adventuring party has been stealthily following the party, and plan to jump them in the treasure room.",
    "No blinking!- As soon as the players step into this room the door locks behind them. The room is mostly normal with the exception that one wall has the words ‘no blinking!’ Written out in huge letters. If the players blink they see where the key is hidden, but only for a split second.",
    "A room filled with artifacts such as gems, ancient pots, weapons. Some are on pedestals but most are scattered on the floor as if someone has ransacked it but left everything inside. A small, golden statue of a dragon lies smashed by an empty pedestal, and at the end is a locked door with no keyhole. A large mirror leans against the wall on the left of the path. Reflected in it is the room, but with everything carefully arranged and the dragon statue unbroken on the pedestal. If the players attempt to steal anything, the pathway they came through liquidates and melts, across, trapping anyone inside the room and crushing anyone in the hall, until it is placed back where it was found. If the room is arranged like in the mirror, including mending the dragon statue, the door at the end slides open.",
    "A hole in the wall, about the height of human shoulders. There is something shiny on the deep end of the hole, however to reach that, you would have to reach inside, and it’s deep enough to swallow your arm up he shoulder. If you reach inside, something bites you, causing 1d4 piercing damage. If you reach inside again, nothing bites you and you are free to take the shiny thing. It’s a single goldpiece.",
    "An old gnome is sat on a barrel smoking a pipe in a corridor of the dungeon, where the path splits into two. He gives the players a pleasant smile, and starts chatting about the draught. If they ask about how he came to be there at gives a vague answer about knocking the area well and directs them down left corridor, promising it’s worth their while. If they do they find a backpack filled with old treasure worth 30gp and the skeleton of a gnome lying beside it. If they go back, the old gnome is gone without a trace.",
    "A large disk floats rotating, a few inches from the circular walls of the room. Through the cracks you can see a deep chasm. At even spaces around the walls there are open and empty tombs, each with a seal floating above it. If the players all venture into the disk it will activate and spin violently, using its centrifugal force to push the players into the tombs or the entrance or exit.",
    "The ghost of the now crumbling manor is not pleased that some adventures are taking his stuff, but instead of attacking, he tries to find some middle ground with the group so he can be left in peace.",
    "In front of the party is a large stone door, possibly of gnomish construction that is covered in thin grooves that seem to make out a labyrinthine maze. In the middle is large ruby red gem that, when touched, shrinks the party and puts them somewhere random inside of it. In order to re-enlarge themselves and exit the labyrinth (thus opening the door) they must find their way back to the gem that now looms menacingly overhead while dodging mechanical spiders and tiny traps.",
    "A tiny telepathic spider offers to show them to a secret shortcut to the end of the dungeon. When followed a phase spider ambushes the party and thanks its child for bringing home dinner",
    "A room with magical darkness cast upon it hides important clues, but the only thing that can dispel the darkness is a living chandelier over the player’s heads. The only problem is that the chandelier can feel pain and doesn’t want to be lit on fire. The party can try to convince the chandelier to let them light it or light it forcefully. If the latter then it screams bloody murder attracting any nearby enemies.",
    "In a completely filled treasure room a single sentient gold coin waits to liberate it’s brothers and sisters. As soon as the player’s backs are turned the gold coin begins animating 2d20 gold pieces a turn and they all make a break for it.",
    "In a large empty circular room in the middle of a tower is a flower surrounded by a ring of fur. If the flower is pulled the room shifts downward a few feet if the fur is ripped out it goes up a few feet. As soon as one is taken. It regrows as fast as it was pulled until it reaches the top or bottom level.",
    "At a junction of hallways, the players notice one hallway has a slight breeze accompanied by a slow, rhythmic wheezing. The air is slightly warm and has an acrid smell. If they seek out the source, it leads to an abandoned forge with an enormous billows. An enchantment keeps the forge warm, like a magical pilot light. The late forgemaster’s bones sit hunched at a workbench with various mechanical drawings. There are various trinkets around the room, some magical, some mundane. If the players take any of the items, they are attacked by a previously dormant construct that was sitting under a cloth in the corner of the room.",
    "The players begin to smell a faint scent of baking bread. Is it delirium, or does someone live down here? Bonus! The smell of baking bread is soon joined by the smell of roasting meat. If the players seek out the source of the smell, they find a crack in the wall that leads to an ancient banquet hall, inexplicably laid out with a feast.",
    "The party finds a door, barred and barricaded. If cleared, the door appears to have been hastily welded shut by pouring molten metal around the edges, and requires a strength check to open. (or some industrious chiseling) When opened, the doorway opens into a void, scattered with stars. The party may step through, and they walk on an invisible surface even with the floor of the dungeon. Who knows what could be found in this strange realm?",
    "A room lined with standing alcoves. The alcoves are inhabited by a body encased in (magical) crystal. A knowledge history check can date the bodies to various eras of history. Near a collection of empty alcoves is a body bearing an item of only recent styling, invention, or popularity.",
    "A barren room with a standing mirror at one end. The mirror is cracked, it appears someone took an axe or sword to it some time ago, but the magical runes around it’s edge still flicker faintly with power.",
    "A room that appears to be a shrine of some kind. It contains a 10 ft wide, 3 ft deep circular pool in it’s center. In the pool, there is a duck. The duck resists all attempts to discern it’s nature, for all intents and purposes, it appears as an ordinary duck. The duck is docile and is content to do regular duck things. If, at any point, a member of the party says ‘I wish…’ within 5 feet of the duck, it quacks, grants the wish, and disappears in a suitably appropriate and silly display.",
    "The dungeon is very cramped, smaller than usual hallways, doors just tall enough to fit through, etc. At the bottom of the dungeon is a large, cavernous chamber containing an enormous monster. Upon inspection, the chamber appears to be a sort of colosseum. The monster may be dead, undead, or alive, and may be immediately aggressive, or just want a friend. It has no understanding of how it got there.",
    "You come across an adventurer/adventurer party that has been magically bounded to a room so they can’t leave the area.",
    "There seems to be a weird hole in the wall that is pitch black. It doesn’t seem to have good magic or evil magic, in matter of fact, there is no magic coming from it. If an object is thrown into it, it shoots straight back dealing 1 damage. If a PC tries to get close, it automatically seals and reopens when no one is within 5 feet.",
    "When you enter the dungeon, after clearing the first few rooms of traps, you realize that the homeless had already cleared out the area and is now using it as a place to live and sleep in, they say it’s better than sleeping in the streets.",
    "The room is raining?",
    "You come across a nice looking devil statue in the middle of a room, after a DC 20 (Investigation) check, it turns out there is a button in its mouth, when pressed, the mouth closes shut dealing 2d4 piercing damage and you can see blood dissolving as it leaves your skin. After 10 seconds it reopens and the statue turns into an imp, this imp now serves under the PC that put their hand in the mouth.",
    "A reverse pit trap; a reverse gravity rune with the pit above instead of below.",
    "The hallway the party is currently in starts to fill with water at about a knee deep height. Waves begin to form on the opposite end of the hall and rush towards the party. Each character in the water must make a DC 13 Dex saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed back 10 feet.",
    "A dwarven fighter, The last survivor of her party, is trying desperately to dig her way out of the dungeon with her war pick. Unfortunately, just as you reach her she breaches the dungeon’s sewers and unleashes a giant crocodile and a swarm of rats.",
    "An enemy Hobgoblin wizard the party is fighting casts shatter and collapses one of the nearby crumbling dungeon walls, revealing the basement of a very confused and panicked Halfling couple.",
    "Pipes high up on the walls in this chamber are dripping some kind of emerald-green liquid into a wall-mounted fountain. The fountain is nearly full. A successful miscellaneous intelligence check tells you that it’s just liquid paint. Highly toxic paint, but just paint. The fountain drains into an adjacent room, which is completely knee-deep in the liquid.",
    "The room contains a number of flensed livestock hanging on hooks, as if you’ve entered a butchery. Alongside creatures appropriate for the area, there are some animals from far away, such as penguins if in a dungeon surrounded by desert. If the party waits long enough, something invisible takes one animal corpse off the hooks and drags it into an adjacent room, where it begins butchering it.",
    "You come across a group of kobold engineers repairing some traps that jammed or are otherwise damaged.",
    "This room contains an 8ftx12ft pool of opaque white liquid, framed by four columns with taut chains leading up to a recess directly above the pool. If any creature is fully submerged into the pool (which is 10ft deep), a large metal mold begins descending from the ceiling recess. It will stop shortly before contacting the liquid if whatever creature entered the pool didn’t get out in time, but will plunge fully into the pool when everything leaves. When the mold returns out of the pool in four(?) minutes, a solid white mannequin in the shape of the submerged creature is atop it. The mannequin animates when there are no witnesses directly observing it, and will stalk the creature it’s modeled after. Perhaps the dungeon denizens are aware of the room’s properties, and have managed to take control of the mannequins to make reinforcements.",
    "A bright lamp hanging on the wall in an otherwise dim hallway, next to a wooden door with thick hinges. The door is locked, but it has a small counter at about elbow height, and a panel above that will open up if anyone tries to open the door or knocks on it. A flickering, jittering undead asks ‘I’m afraid the library is currently closed to visitors, but may I help you find a book?’ It will bring one book of choice for each person within the next few minutes who asks for one, but will not give multiple books to the same person. Books can be requested by very specific parameters (author, edition, hardcover or softcover, title), or by saying something as vague as ‘I’d like a book on cows’, though vagueness is probably less rewarding. The books are deposited on the door counter. Once every person it sees has received a book, or after a few minutes, the undead, door, and lamp vanish, leaving behind an ordinary patch of wall.",
    "A broken down wall of the dungeon leads to a decently sized cave where five cow like animals with purple spots and luminescent horns are grinding their teeth against the stone walls to get the lichen growing inside this crumbling tunnel. If approached slowly they will ignore the PCs, but if the PCs get too close the biggest one will turn towards you and snort while the others run back into the tunnels. If the PCs continue to approach it will attempt to gore one of the PCs with its poisonous horns and will then gallop after its compatriots.",
    "A ghost and a corpse. The ghost is desperately trying to get back into its body so it can rescue its beloved, only it doesn’t realize that hundreds of years have passed and its beloved has likely died, if only from old age.",
    "A sentient chest, not a mimic and not enchanted. Somehow, in some way, the chest has become self aware. It cannot speak or see or hear or taste or feel, but it can ‘sense’ its surroundings somehow. With great effort it can open and close its lid, and with even greater effort it can move slightly across the floor. How the party learns to communicate with it is up to them.",
    "There is a helmet in the corner of this room/chamber. In the next room, there is an identical helmet. This continues for every single room afterwards. Any rooms visited before the first time the party noticed these helmets also have an identical helmet. If someone dons the helmet, they see all of the rooms of the dungeon at once, taking 2d12 psychic damage with a WIS save to halve the damage. This psychic damage occurs every time someone dons the helmet, but if they stick through with it rather than removing it, it can be used to get a brief glimpse of whatever an identical helmet would see in another room once every ten turns by passing a perception check. While someone wears a helmet, the other helmets seemingly vanish. Any damage or modifications inflicted to one helmet is performed on all the others.",
    "The party comes across a glittering egg about the size of an adult halfling in kaleidoscopic colors. If they break it open, there are… more eggs inside, about the size of a normal chicken egg but made of the same material and in the same colors. Each of these can be cooked like an egg, or the party could wait for one to hatch by keeping it heated; a nature check tells you these are basilisk eggs, but luckily newly hatched basilisks don’t have their petrification abilities. A nature check, even if successful, fails to explain why the eggs were inside a larger egg.",
    "There is a pile of gold coins, about 4500gp total. Whenever the DM so chooses (but within a day), they sublimate into thin air- it was all Prankster’s gold. If players return to the same spot, they’ll see empty vials that probably contained the liquid where the pile originally was, complete with labels detailing what the liquid does.",
    "As the party rounds a corner or passes through a chokepoint, a small glinting ball bounces on the ground towards them before exploding into a massive cloud of whitish smoke. The party’s been ambushed by some kind of clever, intelligent pack of hunters, hopefully appropriate to their level. The exits to the room are so small that attempts to blow the smoke away can only siphon away so much at a time.",
    "The party walks into a room to be met only by a button and next to it are scribbles seeming to make out “DO NOT TOUCH.” As the final party member enters the room, the door slams shut and the 4 walls of the room flip, revealing walls lined with spikes that slowly encroach on the party. The walls are indestructible and unstoppable, and every time the button in the center of the room is pressed, the walls recede back to their starting position only to crawl towards the party once more. The only way out if the situation is to heed the advice of the sign. Right as the walls are pressing the party members together, about to impale them all, the walls will reset, for good, and the door will reappear, letting the party escape. The trap can only be reset by having every member of the party leave and then reenter. A funny, harmless trap that will either starve a mistrusting group to death or make them panic.",
    "The walls of this room are lined with intricate carvings that appear to be dwarven in nature. They depict grand battles between dwarves and orcs that lead to a large set of stone double doors at the opposite end of the room. The doors depict a dwarf holding up a hammer that sparks with lightning. In the center of the room are 3 small pedestals and one larger pedestal in the middle. Each small pedestal has a stone tablet on it. Each tablet has a different word written on it: Others, Yourself, and Justice. To get the stone doors on the opposite side of the room to open, the party must put the tablets on the large center pedestal, placing Yourself on the bottom, Others atop it, and Justice at the very top. Once this is completed, the letters JOY will light up and the stone double doors swing open.",
    "Dave – An 78-year old human commoner who has no idea who was captured for slavery by the owner(s) of the dungeon – has a curse on him that activates after 1d4 days, and casts Fireball on him. The curse was applied by his ex, a vengeful witch who he had abandoned after learning of her true nature.",
    "A ghost bard of no fame who never got the chance to perform at the big show. He has come back from the great beyond to find that he can no long play his trumpet.",
    "A room which disguises itself as the childhood room of the first to enter. When enough people enter, the room locks. There is a significant difference that the one who first entered can spot with a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw to escape. Each time they fail, a nightmarish creature based on one of their childhood fears appears and the party must fight it.",
    "An eternal campfire burns in this room. The adventurers shadows appear on the dungeon wall, which turn into Shadows from the Monster Manual. The taller the adventurer, the more powerful the Shadow will be. The fire can only be put out by dousing it with holy water or some other curse removal.",
    "Party enters a smallish, circular room, with a simple wooden door. There is a wooden door on the far side of the room, locked. The room has nothing but a simple wooden table, upon which is a single vase, containing a large, dark purple flower. If the party investigates, the flower is nightshade, and the vase is of unknown origin. Everything here is ordinary, other than the table, which is a mimic. Let it lie still until after the party investigates the flower/vase (if at all), just for the extra surprise factor.",
    "The party finds a scared Gazer whimpering in a corner of a room. It will cry and whimper if the party approaches. If the party can earn its trust, it will hang around and give playful licks. What will happen when the party finds the Beholder searching for his pet?",
    "You come across a large furnace in a dead end of the cave. It’s a fancy, built-in brick oven. If you open its cast iron door you hear faint moans and echoes. Inside it is pitch black, even with darkvision you cannot see the bottom. If you drop a lit torch you see hundreds upon hundreds of zombies and other shambling undead monsters converging on the light until it is extinguished.",
    "A goblin named Sam smorkle who is just looking for rusty things. If given a rusty thing he’ll help you until the next rusty things is found, where he’ll quickly work himself up into a frenzy and accuse you of wanting the rusty item. Roll initiative.",
    "A labyrinth eventually leads to a center room. The room appears to be a study with a table in the middle featuring an exact scale model of the labyrinth, including miniatures of the PCs themselves. Another miniature can be seen, of some hideous monstrosity, and its heading for the center room…",
    "The party finds a tiny portal to the Far Realm. An impossibly huge eye is looking at them… then after a few seconds the portal snaps shut leaving behind an strange small polyhedral made of a hard unknown material that somehow inspires awe and fear.",
    "The party finds an gold vein that has been roughly ‘mined out’. If they follow it, they find a hive of rust monsters eating the ore. If disturbed the RMs with spill out into the dungeon and eventually the surface (maybe destroying a nearby village).",

    "Weaver’s Eve – An artful festival for fabric makers. Celebrates the day when the nearby forest’s local spider population came to the townspeople asking for help to safeguard their nests from foraging cockatrices. The local seamstresses responded by making large, sturdy fabric webs for the spiders to hide in until the cockatrices could be dealt with.",
    "Day of Stone – Celebrated as a masonry recognition day. Began as a day of remembrance some hundreds of years before when Hunters returned to town only to find that every person had been turned to stone by a roaming Medusa.",
    "The Haunt – A day when people offload their grievances with one another, lest they be haunted by holding it in. In recognition of the day long ago when a necromancer bestowed a curse of silent aggression over the town until people began killing one another, then raising them for his army of dead.",
    "The Honey Moon festival – Every few months, the moon will rise with a golden glow for two or three nights. In the little town of &amp;amp;lt;im bad at names&amp;amp;gt; they say that the moon does this when someone, somewhere, finds true love. During these days, tables are set out in the streets and people ask others to join them on dates, platonic and romantic, underneath the golden moonlight (similar to real world valentines dates).",
    "The Barstool Burning – After an incident where a mimic disguised as a barstool bit off a chunk of a poor patron’s bum, the tavern’s inebriated clientele burned all its barstools in the street. An afternoon of drinking and building street bonfires made of barstools and other flammables has since become an annual holiday that has spread to all the taverns in the city.

    "Monster Parade – Once a year, all the cities in region hold a parade where all the participants wear elaborate monster costumes. Larger cities may employ magicians for special effects and have multistory beasts mounted on wheeled carts with movable parts and participants riding inside. The final attraction in the parade is the “holy paladin” with an elaborate armor outfit and costume weapons who is driving the “monsters” away. The role of the paladin is chosen by popularity contest or some other method, and is almost never an actual paladin. The parade celebrates a plot to deter a foreign attack by making it appear that terrifying monsters had already overrun the streets, yet they were easily defeated and driven off by guards.",
    "The Bath and Swim – This “festival” originated in a region with intermittent vampire problems. When another drained person is found, every man, woman, and child in the territory are ordered to assemble and wade across a shallow river. Immobile people are carried and then submerged. A census is then taken, and anyone who didn’t show up or refused (even visitors) is captured and dunked. Bored youths waiting for the trials to end soon started a now traditional swimming contest in the deeper part of the river. Thanks to a pair of enterprising visiting bards, a recurring comedy act developed. Two bards playing an oblivious guard and a vampire sit in a single large wooden bath and deliver “Straight Man and Wise Guy” skits. The comedy act has an informative end: it addresses vampire powers and weaknesses, and cautions against explicitly inviting anyone into your home, or your bath.",
    "Masquerade ball – An event for the upper classes and nobility. Participants ballroom dance while wear highly concealing masks and costumes. Because everyone’s identities are ostensibly hidden, participants are expected to cut loose. Statements challenging authority, outrageous clothing, lascivious dancing, public displays of affection, impoliteness, crude jokes, and open gossip is also permitted. Many champions of silenced and oppressed factions voiced their first manifestos here. The masquerade ball is a can’t-miss for anyone investigating aristocratic allegiances and doings, social climbers seeking courtly influence, and underworld rogues looking for high level protection and buyers.",
    "Catacomb Carnival – Once per year in the great cities the citizens head to the catacombs to celebrate another year alive and honor the dead interred in them by properly cleaning and arranging the bones of those that have been in the catacombs for a year into elaborate structures and designs. Any bones that are damaged in any way are burned in a great pyre in the city square and the ashes are used in the mortar of the bone sculptures below. They also leave offerings to the beetles and rats that do the job of stripping the bodies down to the bone. After the catacombs have been cleaned and the years previous dead have been attended to there is a day and night of celebration where revelers light the catacombs and tunnels and celebrate in procession above and below the streets wearing masks of beetles, rats, and skeletons to ward off any dark spirits and denizens that might also haunt the dark recesses below the city.",
    "The Minstrel Masquerade – A yearly festival wherein bards gather from every kingdom to enjoy one another’s company. Every bard seeks an invitation to such a jovial event, but only a few will be deemed worthy of winning a “Bardy.” The masquerade’s origin stems from the tragedy of Gerrick the Mad. Gerrick was a loyal jester, a bard of Lore, whom kept his sleepless king laughing for 3 months straight. Unfortunately Gerrick was only a man, a simple bard, and when the king finally gave word for him to stop jesting, he fell to the ground, stone dead. This festival exists to honor Gerrick and other bards alike for their insatiable desire to be the best artistic minds in their kingdoms, and the horrid sacrifice Gerrick made for the price of his King’s smile.",
    "The Salmon Bulb Run – It is this time each year that the giant salmon (which dwell within the nearby rivers) finish their yearly rot on the shores of nearby villages. You see, each year the salmon spawn, die, then float to shore causing a special type of psychedelic river mushroom to form on their carcasses (after they rot for approximately a year). These mushrooms are collected and shared amongst the Firbolg community as a right of passage.",
    "Winter’s Ritual Day – To prepare the day before, a branch of the sacred tree is cut and carved into a bowl, in it, runes are scribed asking for what you want come Spring and the next year; fortune, fertility or good health and inside is placed a special candle. After midnight, the candle is lit by a special bonfire created by the temple. A special ceremony is held at midday, where the priest incants a ritual spell ceremony, asking that the city be warded from the Spirit of Winter till next year. After this ceremony, which lasts 5 hours, the people drink ale and sup broth from their bowl cup (candle still lit hopefully), until midnight when they blow out the candle. If your candle goes out beforehand, terrible luck will befall you in the coming year.",
    "Day of Mending – A celebration to better one’s community and strenghten the bonds between townsfolk, this holiday is a day when tailors, crafters, smithies and similar trades set aside their work for a day offer their services for free on small projects for members of their community. As the holiday has grown, it has become a tradition for others to offer their goods and services to the community as well: bakers give away small food stuffs, taverns offer drinks on the house (one per customer!), and musicians and artisans flaunt their talents to all. Many enjoy the holiday as an opportunity to bond with their neighbors and community, while the more savvy use it as an opportunity for self promotion. The primary tenet of the Day of Mending is that old grudges and quarrels are set aside, if only for the day, and folk put the community ahead of the individual before the old business resumes on the following day.",
    "The Lovers’ Return – One night each year, it is said that the spirits of a young man and woman return to roam the town where they died, looking for each other. Old tales tell of the young lovers kept apart, until one committed suicide from grief, only to be shortly followed into death by their partner. Now, the oldest townsfolk whisper of seeing the crimson specter of half-seen figures, sometimes a young man, sometimes a young woman, roaming the town on the night of the Lovers’ Return, rapping lightly on the doors of homes to be let inside to search for their lost love. The townsfolk believe that hanging certain totems around their entryways will keep the lovers from coming to their doors, but even so, every few years a young man or a young woman goes missing on the Lover’s Return, presumably taken away by one of the specters mistaking them for their lost partner.",
    "Winter’s Offering – An old holiday, mostly celebrated by rural farming communities, it serves as both a celebration to venerate the old gods as well as preparing the villages for the winter to come. After the fall harvest, each household is granted a number of bushels of the food grown, while a large portion of it is prepared and sealed in unadorned clay urns to be buried in the ground and kept in reserve for the cold, hungry months of winter. As well, the villagers bury the bodies of their young at this time: the stillborn and the infants who passed in the previous year, their bodies prepared and buried in urns painted black, offerings to the old gods. The old midwives of such communities often keep unruly children in line with tales of how the cries and tears caused by misbehaving children echo into the ground and cause the blackened urns to crack, prompting their buried occupants to crawl their way out to the surface and drag away bad little boys and girls.",
    "Festival of the Sashes – to commemorate the purge of a despotic royal lineage centuries ago, when the ruling family was chased out of town by the commoners, their clothing stripped of their bodies as they ran through the streets. Groups and families prepare mannequins adorned with colorful sashes, each trying to make theirs the most elaborate and festive. The mannequins are then hoisted on poles and carried through the city. The groups race from Royal Plaza to the city gates. People line the streets and try to grab and tear handfuls of the sashes and ornamentation off as the mannequins pass. The atmosphere is very festive with public drunkenness and groups of young people chasing after the mannequins.",
    "Week of Rest – Neighbors take turns cooking meals for each other. Based on when a plague swept through the town and some got better while others got sick.",
    "Monument Race Day – It is said that when a near by volcano erupted destroying the old town, after evacuating their families many of the villagers returned to move the stone monument from the old town center to the new town’s location. In honor of this deed, every year on the anniversary of the eruption, the townspeople form teams that carry replica monuments in a race from the site of the old village to the monuments’s current location. Afterwards the town celebrates by having lava soup (a spicy red tomato based soup), with monument shaped bread rolls.",
    "Lamentations of the Cinders – a somber day of reflection on the anniversary of the Great Fire that killed thousands. At third bell after noon, which is when the fire began, people begin silently filing from their homes. Everyone covers their faces with soot and ash. Particularly devout people or older folk who lost everything in the fire may go completely naked and cover their whole body in soot. Citizens keep their faces downcast as they slowly walk a circuit around the neighborhoods that were most affected. A bell tolls every minute for the lives that were lost. At sundown everyone quietly returns home. Recently people have begun to include a great feast of preserved foods, like jerky, salted fish, and dried fruit afterwards.",
    "Last Tidings – It is said there once was a witchy lass who fell in love with a sailor. He went to sea and for twentyfive years she would wait for him at the sea cliff until the last tide went out at dusk. On the final night of her vigil on the last outgoing tide of the year she received word that her lover had perished. She cursed and vowed to the heavens that nobody would ever have to suffer and wait as long as she did for closure. She performed some unknown ritual and ever since that night, on the last out going tide of the last day of the year, anybody who whispers the name of a loved one on the seaside cliff will either hear the name returned meaning they were still alive or hear the cry of an albatross and know them perished. Two night long festivals have arisen one mourning the other joyous as lovers learn the truth. It is no coincidence that many of the single participants find comfort and more in each other’s company.",
    "Wall of Melons – A hundred years ago the city was under siege. The invaders climbed a wall to get inside only to be rebuffed by peasants who tore down their own homes to toss rocks down on the climbers. The day is celebrated by a committee selecting a portion of wall up witch a the town’s young men try to clamber. At top are an equal bumber of lasses armed with melons both ripe and rotten. It isbl traditional for the first climber up to ask for and be given the hand in marriage of his choice. The climbers are protected by feather fall spells and blanket carrying elders.",
    "Sweet Night – The orchids of fruit trees in the town’s fields are pollinated by bats from a local cave. This wasn’t known until a hundred years ago when a vampire ravaged the country side. It was tracked back to the cave and burned out, scattering the bats as well. The next years harvests were bad until a traveling holy man told the villagers they must lure the vats back. This was done by pouring syrup and other sweets out on a long path from orchards to cave. It worked and has become an annual event to remind and thank the bats. The sweets used have become candies for children and alcohol for adults. It starts with a barnfire at dusk and culminates in a long hike to the cave. Dancing and costume wearing is common as well as many bat theme toys and souvenirs.",
    "War of the Monsters – An Olympic sports like event with many different athletic competitions and games. The main event is a destruction derby style event where groups make “monster wagons”. Essentially people driven/powered wagons/carts that are made to look like monsters of the world (dragons, dire animals, beholders, etc). The goal is just to disable the opponents wagons, not hurt the drivers. Last monster wagon still able to roll wins. History harkens back to a day many many years, when several large wild monsters wandered into town at the same time. They ended up fighting each other rather then attacking the people, in a territorial dispute. This gave the civilians time to evacuate and adventurers time to gain control of the situation. Contradictory stories developed how one monster (it’s always a different one, since no one agrees which it was) was actually there to save the City from the other monsters. As several monsters actually escaped, this “hero” monster is said to still be out there guarding the city. People in the city are split into groups by what monster they believe is their guardian.",
    "Day of stillness – No-one goes outside or opens doors for 3 days. Very worrying to newcomers to the huge city. It is surreal to see a giant city completely still and silent. Almost no lights and no answers. In remembrance in how they barely escaped the plague by not greeting any infected during those trying times.",
    "Day of the Hawk – Adepts at the shortbow and longbow compete in a test of skill and accuracy (ex. piercing a thrown copper penny-sized item in the center), hitting fast moving targets from horseback. Gnome artificers, smiths, and other weapons craftsmen travel to the city from far and wide to tout their new inventions and wares. The festival began when the city was a small village and those who came of age had to prove their proficiency with the weapon as part of demonstrating their skills in order to successfully hunt and defend the community.",
    "The Day of Ribbons – An annual occasion where beautiful ribbons are tied to posts all over town. When asked why, people only give a somber look. Nobody speaks about it, giving the impression that it’s disrespectful and insulting to do so.",
    "The Night of Burning – In memory of the defeat of an ancient black dragon that had kept them in slavery, this town has an annual tradition where they kill, cook, and eat a juvenile black dragon.",
    "Orctoberfest – A yearly weeklong celebration commemorating the defeat of a massive army of orcs that had once besieged the city. Lots of drinking of fermented beverages, dancing, and general public revelry.",
    "Market’s Day – A day of great deals and bargains from merchants and vendors. It marks the beginning of the new market year and celebrates when the open trading and selling of dwarven and elvish wares to humans was legalized throughout the land.",
    "Candlenights – A night when the entire city holds a candlelight vigil until the dead of night, and then exchanging gifts and celebrating with a feast. Groups of families and neighbors stand around the city in patches, while holding their candles up high. This commemorates the time when a group of adventurers killed a nest of gold dragons, relieving many of the farmers of the fear of being killed and their crops burned. The adventurers brought back the dragon’s hoard to share with the town, but because of a raging blizzard, had to be guided in by groupings of torches.",
    "Day of Snakes – a day literally celebrating the existence of snakes. Vendors sell all kinds of snake-related items, restaurants serve dishes with a bit of snake flair added on, and people release their pet snakes all around town. This goes far back to when there was a large rat pestilence in the town, and it looked like it would never get better until a random snake merchant came to town and offered to begin breeding snakes for them in order to control the population. Disease rates fell, overall cleanliness increased, and the town felt better overall after the rats were driven down to a dwindle.",
    "Propitiation of the Twins – around twenty years ago a pair of shooting stars appeared in the night sky. Soothsayers and astrologers predicted that this would usher in a new age of prosperity. People began leaving offerings in public squares to entice “the Twins” to bless their household. Now, every year on the anniversary, people have continued the tradition by lighting two candles and leaving a small bread cake in a public area at dusk.",
    "Boulder Pushing Day – On this day every year, the town splits into 2 teams (east and west). Using the whole town as a playing field, they attempt to push a boulder sized ball (many years ago they realized that a real boulder caused too much damage to the town)towards the opposite side of town. The winning team must push the ball into the outskirts of the town on the opposing side. It’s a friendly competition akin to a high school sports rivalry. Those who cheat or intentionally hurt others are looked down upon by their peers. The town sits in a u shaped valley that they say the gods carved out by rolling a marble on flat land.",
    "The day of Ashes – more of a ritual than a actual holiday. At this specific day of the year, the towns women get dressed in white and their faces are covered behind a veil. They roam the streets in packs singing and dancing, while the men, all dressed in black, try to coerce the women into having intercourse. Women are treated like goddesses, gifts are given to them and they have free choice of taking or refusing a partner. Each woman has a pot filled with ashes with her. After they have found and bedded their man of choice, they empty their pot onto his clothes, so the other women know not to touch them. This tradition comes from ancient times, when after a volcanic eruption the lands were covered with ashes and many people were killed by the initial eruption or starved to death in the aftermath of the event. To ensure the survival of the ancient tribes in this region, the council of all tribes instated the law of reproduction. What the town celebrates today is the day for the gods and the women, who ensure the succession of their lineage.",
    "Festival of the Drink – Long long ago, a small group of dwarfs set out into the wilderness to establish a new outpost for the glory of their empire. When they finally settled down, they were quickly able to establish a secure outpost with plenty of food, but soon they realized they were missing one of the most important supplies of all. Alcohol. Without this necessity, order soon began unraveling in the fledgling outpost, until the lone brewer was forced to improvised. Facing no other choice, she ordered everybody to gather as much of any kind of fruit that they could find. Once the gathering was complete, she worked tirelessly for a week straight to make alcohol out of anything the other dwarfs had brought, churning out such strange brews such as cherry wine and plum cider. At the end of this massive burst of brewing brilliance, the anxiously waiting dwarfs were finally rewarded with the finest tasting drink they had ever tasted in their life. In remembrance, the now flourishing Dwarven outpost celebrates this event in it’s history by holding a festival every year where brewers compete to create the best brew possible from the local fruit chosen for that year.",
    "The Sun God Observation Day – On this day all the village observers the sun god. I.e. stare at the sun as long as possible. The people at the village do this because an old witch told them that it would prevent them from seeing the destruction of the village. Since everyone is mostly blind her prophecy seems to have come true.",
    "Wishmore Night – The city holds a festival at the docks, all walks of life are included and encouraged to mingle with each other. Everyone, either individually or in groups create floating wreaths in whatever way they want to present it. At midnight when the water is still, the leader of the city will wade out into the water and release their wreath first, as an offering to the gods. Everyone in turn will release theirs following the leadership, before returning to the festivities which will often go long into the next night. This celebration is to thank the gods for a bountiful year, or even a year of character building (in case of hard times). It is to mourn those lost in the Shipping routes and to pray for the safe return of others. If the water isn’t disturbed except for the wreaths, it is fabled to be a year of easy storms for the sailors. It is also of note that these wreaths never ever turn up anywhere else in the world. They disappear completely.",
    "Celebration of Destruction – The Nine Hells love the awakening of the tarrasque so much that they make it a festivity. The celebration comprises of feasting upon whatever the titan destroyed and watching it as it rampages through entire cities, leaving nothing but rubble and dead life of all varieties in its wake. After the gargantuan beast falls asleep once again, all of devil kind praise the strength and ferocity of the powerful tarrasque.",
    "Ale Day – A dwarven celebration that simply commemorates the invention of their favorite drink. It quickly spread to many other humanoid peoples. Dwarves and satyrs love it the most.",
    "Owlbear Memorial Day – Elven cities that use owlbears as defense use this day to give thanks to the beasts that have protected their land for decades, sometimes centuries. The whole town offers food of all kinds for the creatures below. It’s very easy to argue that the owlbears enjoy this day more than the elves above ever could.",
    "Festival of Life – A celebration of the Upper Planes where the denizens of the heavens celebrate the good in every creature of the Material Plane. Commonly occurs when large amounts of good, neutral, or unaligned creatures are born. This involves animals and humanoids alike. A huge feast is held with some of the most delicious food in existence.",
    "Day of the Arts – An elven celebration where every form of art is honored. For months before this day, humanoids all across the Material Plane prepare songs, plays, dances, paintings, sculptures, and many other forms of art. A favorite day for many satyrs, with many placing it right behind Ale Day in their lists. Bards of many peoples are particularly fond of this festival. Silver dragons also love to celebrate alongside the humanoids that have arrived.",
    "Beholder Day – A holiday invented by beholders to celebrate themselves. They give themselves presents, and demand that their servants get them presents or they die. If a cult has decided to worship the floating aberration, the beholder will only have to remind its worshipers once and it has a myriad of presents coming its way. Unlike normal holidays that occur annually, Beholder Day happens once every week.",
    "Cliffton Day – Cliffton was a local legend who long ago had defeated a demon water elemental which came upon the small fishing village of Mistwood. They celebrate his triumph every year with contests which correlate to what traits he was known for. Whoever wins any of the contests then participates in a final contest, the winner of which is given the title of “Aspect of Cliffton,” and is then invited to participate in a ceremonial recreation of the famous battle. They are given a costume and Cliffton’s old ax and told to strike down an effigy – a standing effigy of the demon is already in center of town, but underneath the rags which make up the costume is a bound man, the village drunk, being put to death without knowledge of the adventurers. Maybe now that the adventurer is close to the figure, they can hear strained breathing amidst the cheers and song of the villagers. If they refuse to complete the ceremony, the same water demon who attacked the town years ago rises from the nearby lake and threatens to destroy the town once again. As it turns out, the killing of a man in the ritually-prepared town square once a year is part of a ritual that keeps the demon at bay.",
    "The Betrothment Battle – Every year on the first weekend after the Summer solstice, the town plays host to a wrestling tournament and exhibition. Hand to hand fighters from across the realm come to the town to prove their mettle, and rings are prepared for non-tournament participants to settle small arguments that have built up over the year. Named for a famous fight in the town at the wedding of the Mayor’s son and one of the prominent merchant’s daughters that saw the merchant, the mayor and most of their families tear apart the public house, the tavern, and a stable in an hours long fight.",
    "The Wardens Gauntlet – In the spring the city’s best and brightest face each other in a series of physical and mental challenges. Some are complex rituals, puzzles and riddles testing mind and spirit. Others are tests of endurance, agility, and strength. Betting and boasts are a much enjoyed portion and the contests themselves are openly viewed by the public to cheer on their favorites. The top three are given the honorary title of Warden followed by celebration where the previous Wardens hand off the mantle to any new Wardens or retain their station from the previous year. These Wardens represent the common people in matters of ceremony and any concerns or grievances to the Crown and city councils until the next years contest. Being a warden is often the path to guild leaderships or council seats and even titles from the crown. The history behind the trials and celebrations is vaguely remembered from the time of city states when open warfare was avoided by settling issues between the Wardens of each city state. There was also a darker reason for the intricate rituals and ceremony. Now considered just a spiritual and mental exercise, they serve an unknown purpose strengthening ancient Runes and Spells against something truly horrific that is ever vigilant and hungry.",
    "Stabbing Day – Using fake daggers the populace honors the day a group of rouges saved the city from a dragon attack. It’s exactly what you think, expect red dye stains.",
    "Rom’Chuk – Local barbarian tribes meet together in an unfortunate city and hold a Dwarf tossing contest. Use of Gnomes with fake beards is extremely frowned upon.",
    "Siggi’s Birthday – A great shield maiden gave her life to save the city. Women can let anyone they are sweet on know by picking them up over their shoulders and hauling them off. Siggi wasn’t known for her subtlety. Rooms at the Inn are free in her honor.",
    "The Games – A week of festivities that include games of all types under the sun; from dexterity-tests like obstacle courses, to strength competitions such as log-tossing, and even an academia note to it, like a spellcaster’s competition. This week of fun was created some time ago when a tyrant ran the city with an iron fist. Once a year he would force his supplicants to participate in crazy games which usually ended in their death. Once he was overthrown, the citizens opted to keep the week of festivities, whilst removing the “death” part. It helped the community grow closer, keeping those with terrible ambitions out.",
    "The Pilgrimage – A day when every person in the city is expected to “carry their weight” and bring their greatest distress out in the open, so that their neighbors, friends and community may support them in earnest. Those who refuse to participate are exiled from the community until they complete a pilgrimage to the neighboring continent and bring back something that will actively make their community better; be it money, food, or magical wards. This is a practice from when the city was still just a fledgling town and every person needed to pull their own weight, and everyone relied on everyone else to support each other.",
    "Lottery Day – A crop fertility ritual where outsiders are encouraged to attend. Eventually someone is picked at sundown and stoned to death by the crowd. Do not take the raffle tickets they offer…but there are prizes afterwards.",
    "Day of the Horn – the ceremony draws in tieflings like moths to a flame. Almost hypnotized by the low droll of an ancient obsidian tiefling skull horn being played amongst the music. Dusk brings the climax of the festival where all the spirits of an ancient battle posses the revelers and show them an ancient battle where a contingent of tieflings rebelled against their fiend masters and joined with the townsfolk to drive the demons back to Hell. The leader selflessly gave her life to save her comrades and new friends by blowing a smoldering hole through the chests of no more than 15 fiends…leaving just her skull. “We Remember” is the mantra and afterwards the tieflings are thanked and cared for with the thought “We can be more than the sum of our parts”.",
    "Madel’s Star Day – A meteorite fell to form a crater where a town eventually sprang up. The 5 meter rock absorbs all hostile magic and steals any illusions. The soothing rhythmic glow is amazing to behold. Only a handful of elders have metal bracelets fashioned from the meteorite that allows them to cast spells in town. Only one new one is awarded every century. In town it allows for casting of spells, outside of town it has a chance to absorb a hostile one (even your own). The properties of the stone also royally mess with any Warforged that come into contact with it.",
    "Grey Snow Day – A volcanic instability in the area uncovered a ruined fiend city. Excavations uncovered ancient masks that the party goers wear. The volatile nature of the masks grant a limited form of fire manipulation after sun down. The party notices that a vague form of possession is slowly corrupting the crowd every year.",
    "Fomarath Day – Laurel and oak wreaths are adorned and offerings prepared for the four treefolk guardians in a nearby permanent druid grove. A group of Hill Giants were about to lay waste to a group of farmers when a druid and his party drove them off. The druid stayed behind for a year to make sure the spell would stick. The treefolk actually love the townsfolk and have attracted other peaceful sentient plants.",
    "Craghoof Moot – A nomadic band of centaurs and a nearby halfling settlement have a very intertwined history of one ancestor saving another or one group saving the other from invasion. The most noble thing a member could do is swear an oath to one another to ride together for a year and a day protecting the territory. The amount of high grade alcohol and mead available is mind boggling. Watching halflings in war paint and centaurs in straw hats and vests is quite hilarious.",
    "The Druid Chain festival – As a last ditch protection against incursions into this dimension three druids, twelve elementals, and three dragons can unite and merge for a primordial ritual called a Gaia Chain to drag whatever horror that threatens all existence into the maw of the planet itself trapping it within the molten core for all eternity. It kills all those involved and as such the three temple locations became holy places to all forms of life. It is the raw elemental fury and power of the first ones that saved the world are remembered in giant soul crystals that once a year show the images of these lost heroes.",
    "Broken Toy Day – Warforged holiday marking their Independence.",
    "The Anniversary of The Great Mayhem – Recalls the day tribe of barbarians, orcs, and goblins laid absolute waste to a city of necromancers, warlocks, and wizards.",
    "Eeling – every autumn as the eel population in the local reservoir grows too great, the Swanmay invite the local village to come and collect as many as they can stock for the year. While fresh eel is on the menu, the festival itself is a community occupation, jarring eels, processing oil from them and otherwise making sure that what they want will keep until next year. Large communal tables are set up in the town square and the locals gather early to get a place at the centre most tables where gossip and ale flow strongest.",
    "Digging High – At summer solstice the various dwarven families of the area come to The Kin Hole, where they will mine as one for the three days of the festival. The hole itself is barren of valuable minerals, but the myth that the families’ ancestors divined great wealth for all dwarven kind at its completion still exists. While much merriment is made by the dwarves, the presence of outsiders is an immediate dampener.",
    "Gluttony – though not a festival per se, the first two months of the year are always eagerly anticipated by the hobbi… the halflingses of Portree. The tradition of the wealthier houses organising lavish bashes during the time as a means of canvassing has replaced a very loose sense of meritocratic governance with a very enthusiastic intoxicracy.",
    "The Quiet – in the old days, the village of Pertiv was in a most precarious position. Early settlers had grouped to farm an area which they only later realised was threatened by orcs, owlbears and darker things from below. While everyone celebrates the heroes who saved the village all those years ago rambunctiously in Spring, in late autumn the people remember the early days of fear and salvation by drinking heavily together in silence. Any but the most necessary and cursory communication is looked down on, and there are those in the village old enough to remember those times from their childhood.",
    "Fyre – The burning of the Winter Witch. They say that the Winter Witch (who is the spirit of winter) is dull and dreary, but can be driven away with humor and merriment. Villagers celebrate by erecting bonfires and once the sun touches the horizon they are set alight. They drink mulled wine, play games in the snow and sing crude songs to drive the Winter Witch away.",
    "Grimm – Orcish first blood ritual. An orc is a child until they are blooded, among the more civilized tribes of orcs this takes place in a festival called Grimm. Those deemed worthy or are brazen enough to try form a Wog or raiding party then a suitable target is chosen usually small Kobold warren or goblin outpost. All participants must bring back a heart for Grummush (their god) and a head to prove their prowess.",
    "Spring Break Wizard Demolition Derby – A popular beachside town is inundated by hundreds to thousands of student and apprentice wizards from several large nearby schools out on holiday break. The wizards inevitably form carousing groups, get absolutely sloshed, and then try to show off their spells to intimidate rival schools, impress potential dates, or simply cause chaos. In order to keep the wizards out of town proper and redirect the damage, the town sets up beer gardens, bathrooms, dirt cheap “inns”, and other sacrificial establishments on the beach. The student wizards naturally make it their goal to destroy absolutely every temporary structure they can, culminating in a massive destruction derby on the final night. Meanwhile, the city residents cower and hope the dispatched army can keep them from invading and burning down the town, again.",
    "Spring Break Playwright Championship – A popular beachside town is inundated by hundreds to thousands of student and apprentice bards from several large nearby schools out on holiday break. The bards inevitably form carousing groups, get absolutely sloshed, and then try to outdo the acts of rival schools, impress potential dates, or simply make a name for themselves. In order capitalize on their creative output and increase tourism, the town builds temporary theaters on the beach. The student bards naturally make it their goal to claim the most audience. Students create original productions in several different categories, marching band, full orchestra, historical drama, tragic opera, comedy musical, dance, etc. and debut them head to head against rival groups from all the different schools. The one who captures the most audience wins. On the final night, all the student bards join together for an all night jam session. The city residents who aren’t spectating are out cold after over-drinking during productions. (Free alcohol is often used to bait audience members.)",
    "Spring Break Ascetic Training Festival – A popular mountain town is inundated by hundreds of student and apprentice monks who jogged hundreds of miles to sit under cold waterfalls made of fresh snowmelt. The monks tend to be fairly orderly since this location is a prime spot to focus one’s ki and discover new techniques. Some waterfalls have better reputations than others, so the student monks will challenge each other for superior meditation spots. The poor fasting students monks tend not to bring much revenue, but tourists who want to watch them fight do. The town constructs several “arenas” sculpted from natural materials with silenced stands so the monks are not disturbed in their combat or meditation. The town hosts a streetside festival with many booths on the final day with rich foods for the starving monks and tourists to enjoy. Some more enterprising monks also do demonstrations or offer basic self-defense classes to tourists.",
    "The Bathing – Held at the height of summer. A highly respected priest started this tradition many years ago for those who could not afford to enter the elitist bath-houses. Townspeople gather at the calmest part of a great river just outside of town and bath naked. Considered a family friendly event, those who attend forgo their qualms about nudity and know that all are equal in the eyes of the constantly moving water.",
    "Lock Day – A small town dug up a mountain 90 years ago to make room for a new city hall, but ended up finding a black safe with an unbreakable lock. It can’t be moved or destroyed by any means (even a disintegration spell). Every year, they have a big festival where people try to open the lock. Everyone expects them to fail, but it’s the fun in trying. They amp them up too; an announcer holler their praises…”weighing in a 220 pounds, the scourge of Neverwinter, the axe-wielding monster, [barbaian character name]. But there’s drinking, dancing, a ceremony from the town’s Cleric, trading, cookies and cakes for sale. It’s a wonderful good time. Then…one day…the safe opens by itself.",

    "Celebration of Armistice – Once a year, the ambassadors of every major city in the neighboring continents bring gifts to all the smaller hamlets and towns around the land. Gifts include anything from supplemental food to last for a long winter, new technologies, mages looking to relocate and can lend a hand to smaller communities… This tradition goes back some centuries, long enough that even few elves remember the origins. Legend says that a great tyrant sought to control the lands around, and a massive war raged for a long time. Eventually the tyrant was assassinated from the inside of his court, and his officers extended an olive branch to the peoples around, before disappearing themselves.",
    "Festival of Limitless Water – A yearly celebration in town, where townsfolk race boats, swim, drink locally brew beer and feast on roasted fish.

    "Leatah’s Warming – the town celebrates the anniversary of their religious rebith to the forest spirit Leatah, who accepted the hospitality of the town many years ago.

It turned out to be a hit, and the halflings have been heralded as heroes to their city from that point onward.",
    "Nymm – The Grand Cookoff – Contests of the best food and drink. It’s held in Gatherhold by the House Ghallanda. The roots here go back a very long time to when the local Patriarch would force his cooks to eat their dish in front of him, to ensure that it was not poisoned. Long after he died, the tradition was carried on, but without the terrible connotations.",
    "Lharvion – The Costumed Carnival – Everyone is in costume and there are costume games.

    "Aryth – The Great Headstrong Races, this is a time of personal speed races; foot races, climb races, mud tobogganing, etc. A festival honoring the legend of Aryth, who is known as the fastest creature to live.

They say that he ran so fast, that his soul ran right out of his body, because he died shortly after delivering the warning.",
    "Vult – The Rogues Escapade. A fair about getting into and out of trouble. Teams devise cunning traps that the other team must escape from, then they switch.

    "Fields of Cabbage Festival – Heads of cabbage are provided to all attendants, wherein they must begin to eat the cabbage. Attractions there include all kinds of ways to prepare cabbage, giant cabbages that have been hollowed out, cabbage stories, cabbage planting seminars.

This strange celebration goes far back to when the only thing that a nomadic tribe of people had left to eat was cabbage, and some people went insane because of it.",
    "Day of the Siren – Quite unnerving for a first time traveler to witness. About 1/3 of the city’s population will meet in the square every 3-4 hours during daylight, and only once after nightfall. They will scream, shriek, wail, shout, or otherwise make vocal noise at the highest possible volume. This came about as a defense from a siren who once lured too many of the city’s capable workers during a particularly hard summer. The shrieking was designed to scare off the siren as her song was sung, and after it was confirmed she had died, the city kept it up as a final insult to the dead fey.",
    "Founder’s Blessings – A day when the local clerics hold a vigil in the streets, doling out blessings or healing as needed.

    "Bride’s day – Commemorating the beginning of summer, all the new brides dance with the unmarried women, to imbue to them their own marital fortunes.

    "Anthem – the proud holiday of the city where a multitude of people gather drunkenly in the streets to sing bawdy songs loudly and obnoxiously. Anyone who asks them to keep quiet is met with a barrage of rotten fruits and/or vegetables. This comes from a long time of religious oppression brought by a cadre of evil paladins. The singing was the first act of rebellion, and the rotten fruits signify when the city folk began attacking to drive them out.",
    "Sturgeon’s Wish – people catch wild sturgeon in the nearby river, put them in portable tanks and spend the day feeding them all kinds of crap before sending them back off to the river. Lots of fish due this way. Origins are iffy, but there’s a legend about a giant talking fish that came out of the river and asked for food from the elders of the city.",
    "Bargaining Day – A day when all villagers have a chance to ask their greater community to help them with something. The community can ask for something in return, or nothing at all. No guarantee of a request being honored, even with payment given. This dates back to when the town used to have an elder dragon living beneath it. They would plead with the dragon for help, and it would make requests of them, sometimes with a promise to honor their plea, but often ignoring them.",
    "The Rain Run – One the day of the first rain after the summer months, the entire town gathers on the outskirts and has a race. Anyone who finishes in the top ten are exempt from the strenuous labors that come with damming up the rivers, or strengthening the embankments around the city to prevent mudslides. This promotes a lean and fit community.",
    "Silence Peak – A day when no one in the city will utter a single word. All communications are done using basic sign language. Anyone who speaks is tied up in the middle of the town square for the remainder of the day. Going back to when a powerful and malevolent wizard ruled the region, using listening spells to seek out malcontents and squash rebellion before it began. Eventually people coordinated in silence, and he was over thrown.",

    "Deep in the forest, approaching dusk, the party finds a logging camp. Several small cabins and a mill. Smoke curls lazily up from one or two of the chimneys. There is nobody in the camp. There are plates of food on tables, still warm. Clothes on a washing line are still damp. Only the doors into the mill are locked. As night falls, a fierce storm begins to build, and from the mill the saws can be heard rasping back and forth, though they don’t sound quite right…",
    "The party finds a scraggly, disheveled child apparently lost in the forest. It asks the party for help, should the party agree, they come under the effects of a curse until they defeat the child (Actually a restless Evil) who flees, attempting to lead them into a hazard deeper in the forest.",
    "Small dolls sit in a tree the players pass by. They are wearing crude clothes, and don sticks of specific lengths. Poor perception rolls feel anonymous sets of eyes gazing at you, while good perception rolls can discover them. These dolls, if ignored, will appear again in a different tree a few feet up, requiring lower rolls as they subtly make themselves more obvious. Upon the first investigation, you find that the dolls are poorly stitched together, with leaves still poking out of the burlap fabric, and expressionless faces with small stones as eyes. However, with each successive perception roll as the party walks away, the dolls become slightly more realistic. On additional rolls their rock-eyes appear to follow you (Mona Lisa style), their skin becomes taut and leathery, and their clothes become more realistic. Repeat as necessary, with the players unable to leave a small section of the forest (due to magical barriers, or because walking straight forward keeps leading them back to the same spots.) Eventually, all of the dolls should clearly resemble everyone in the party. It is important that the dolls never appear to move on their own, and in every way act as though an inanimate object would. They can be destroyed, ripped, held, carried, etc. There should also be at least 4 separate perception checks on the dolls IMO. It really draws the frustration out, and that is an expression of fear. The final perception check on the dolls will have the dolls be very hard to find, except by one person, who you can choose beforehand. No matter how well other party members roll, the person you choose will feel a tingling on the back of their neck, and turn around to find the dolls in a high branch. They are nearly perfect mimics of the party, and are standing around the doll that looks like the person who discovered them, whose doll has a thick piece of string around their neck. The person feels paralyzed as the can only just watch due to fear, as time slows around them. The doll-party gazes directly into the player characters real eyes, and gently… pushes. For extra effect, have a pencil ready to snap upon this moment. Sometimes the cheesy sound effect speaks volumes more than words. The party will usually react at this point, let them destroy the dolls. It’s cathartic. If you want to continue the fear though, every one in a while later on, let them see a flicker of movement out of the corner of their eyes. Bonus points if you pick a grunge or mistake to build this off of. Like if a cleric forgets to heal a fighter and the fighter calls, have one of them be the one that pushes the other off, as though the cleric purposely didn’t heal, or the fighter was trying to get revenge. If the party has a rogue, have their doll slip a stick in the back of the hanged on. There’s a ton of customization you can do, and if done well, you can seed a lot of discord between two player characters and build their relationship to be really dynamic. Happy Creepy Crawlies.",
    "After spending more and more time in the forest, the players start to notice the trees have grown faces. It’s unknown if this is just them going crazy, or if it’s real.",
    "As the party sets down for camp they hear a muttering in the shrubs and then creeping out from it they behold a Gibbering Mouther, each eye and mouth seemingly drawn from a different creature, without repetition. Just before their skin and brains begin to itch, each party member realizes they do not recognize any of their kind yet among its monstrous morphology…",
    "As the night lengthens, from the shadows surrounding the campfire, come the light chiming sounds of children’s laughter. The laughter gets louder as the flames fall to coals.",
    "The wood you gathered for the night is not enough to keep the flames high all night and the sounds are deeper from the dark woods.",
    "A sweet glade, dappled with sunlight and shadows provide a relief from the previous heat and humidity. A gentle brook flows along one edge and gurgled merrily. Several fruit trees sit in the center and lay heavily with ripe fruits. Flowers fragrant the air and a gentle breeze cool the glen, sweetening the air and cooling the weary traveler. An old body hangs from a limb of the tree, but upon inspection it appears obvious they could have stood and not strangled.",
    "You come across an alter, freshly used and dripping with blood. Meat has been portioned and set out for something.",
    "An open clearing shows the remains of several bodies arranged in a glyph like patter. Due to dismemberment and missing pieces you are not sure how many bodies were used. As you review the scene, the trail behind you vanishes and leaves naught but deep and ancient thorn bushes, redolent with the faint reek of decaying flesh.",
    "A medium sized hut made of gingerbread and various pieces of candy. A kindly old woman asks you in for dinner.",
    "A pile of shit with human clothes, hair and bones in.",
    "The party find a clearing with an odd nature alter in the center. While they are distracted, the trees around them move closer. If they are distracted for long enough, the trees form a complete wall. The trees do not attack; they only defend themselves if attacked.",
    "There is a tree with deep scratches in it, as if it has been attacked by a dagger. Upon inspection, the player discovers old, dried blood embedded in the bark and writing in a deep red color that says ‘Find me, help me’ (illusory script). As the party continues they see more trees of a similar nature, and eventually find a crazed gnome who is determined to eat party members in order to restore his youth.",
    "The path opens into a clearing. Near the center is a unicorn lying down on its side. It looks serene and peaceful. The clearing is bright and quiet. Almost silent but for distant birdsong. If the party approach they realize it is dying. Its throat is torn open by some powerful beast and the wound looks infected or poisoned. The edges of the clearing are creeping in, going brown or fungus laden and choked with weeds and branches, which seem to close in whenever no one is looking in that direction. The unicorn is probably (?) past any help the party can give but may last an hour. Left to its own devices, the clearing will close in maybe 20 minutes.",
    "The trees appear to be leaning closer together and are a different shade of green to normal trees. As a breeze blows they seem to be whispering to each other wisha…wisha…wisha",
    "The undergrowth is thick confining you to a narrow path. It switched sharply left then right…. to a dead end. Turning back it is a dead end that way. The only way forward is to hack through the lower branches and scrub. As the players do, the cut stems ooze blood. If burned instead the wet plants hiss and whistle as they burn sounding like tortured screams.",
    "You begin to notice that everything looks familiar. Slowly it dawns on you that the trees are all identical, right down to that twig that snapped off when it caught on you backpack.",
    "A family of forest giants has caught the scent of the party while hunting. They’re catching up.",
    "Disembodied screams echo around you. Ghosts of the past? Or maybe it’s Jim the halfling rogue, trying to scare off tourists so he can start a coalmine?",
    "In the distance you see a light. When you get closer you see a lamp hanging from a tree swinging in the wind. It is full of oil but there are no signs of whoever put the lamp there.",
    "You find humanoid skeletons tied together to form the rough shape of a horse. If you use speak with dead on it, it only screams.",
    "You suddenly realize that all the noise in the forest is gone. As if silence had been cast but you can still talk and make noise as normal. Suddenly the forest is filled with howls, screeches, and buzzing so loud it deafens the party. When the party can hear again the forest is back to normal.",
    "You come across a cottage in the woods belonging to a friendly woodsman and his wife. They provide food and shelter for the night. When the party awakes they are in the burned down ruins of a cottage with the skeletal remains of the farmer and his wife reaching desperately for the party.",
    "A hooded figure sits on a stump. He does not respond to anything. If you attack or touch the figure they collapse into a swarm of spiders.",
    "A parrot is found on a branch repeating the words ‘Gods what is that?!’",
    "The party finds a wanted poster tacked to a tree with a group shot of the party with a red X marked through two of the party members faces. The party does not remember posing for this picture nor know why they would be wanted.",
    "You come upon a dry riverbed. From the trees lining the banks dangle a hundred mutilated corpses.",
    "Two children play fight with sticks, laughing and taunting each other. When they notice the party watching, they’ll happily put on a show. That’s when the other children emerge from the trees, only they aren’t playing and they’ve got more than just sticks and stones.",
    "A strangely inviting cave comes in to view. Surely it’s some kind of den and we shouldn’t go in but I just… cant…. help it.",
    "From deep within the forest loud clicking and chattering noises of various pitches and tempo can be heard. Upon inspection a small city raiding party dressed in armor have been brutally mutilated with heads twisted round and limbs ripped off. The same clicking noise starts again and gets closer and louder. When it seems like the creature is on top of them it suddenly stops and does not reappear.",
    "It has been at least 24 hours since sunset and it has yet to come back up. What’s worse is that all the forest chatter from insects and wildlife has trickled nearly to a standstill save for one slow but consistent crunching that has been following at a distance for hours now. Are the stars even moving anymore?",
    "Early in the day the party passes underneath a suit of armor suspended in the trees, branches occupying the inside of the suit as if they had squeezed out the body that occupied it before. Branches sprout from the facemask wildly, limbs protrude from the leg and armholes, and the entire chest piece is nearly bursting from the volume of foliage it contains.",
    "Just when its time to make camp for the night yet again within the damp cold forest, the party comes across an old house sitting unoccupied in a small clearing. They seek comfort in the house, building a fire in the hearth and drinking some old booze left by previous tenants. Keeping good watch, they peer out the windows frequently. Maybe it’s just the old wine but are the trees…. getting closer?",
    "A few chickens are pecking at the dirt in the middle of the trail. When you come upon them, you spook them, and they trot off into the forest a few meters. They resume pecking; but little does anyone know that they’ve begun to peck seeds that have the effect of the enlarge spell. Treat an enlarged chicken as an allosaurus and let the fun begin.",
    "Glowing eyes stare out of a knothole in an old and gnarled tree. When the players notice it watching, the thing scampers deeper into the tree. If they investigate the knothole they’ll find it goes deep, deeper than the tree itself. At the bottom of the hole something glitters. Gold? Many more glowing eyes stare up around it.",
    "A corpse sways in the branches of a lonely willow by a stream, dangling from a noose. The corpse is grinning, and dancing a slow, merry jig.",
    "Something howls in the distance. Another something responds. Not wolves. The howls are too ragged, sound too much like words.",
    "A little twig-and-twine doll is pinned to a branch up ahead. Another just like it can be seen just off the path, and another beyond that one. Even in the depths of the woods you’ll be protected so long as you follow them. Your safety once you arrive where they’re leading you is less guaranteed. A polite invitation has been extended. It won’t come again.",
    "Moaning can be heard from a bush. Within is a hunter, near-death, near incoherent from fear. No mere animal could have inflicted the wounds he bears. They’re too precise, suggestive of strange symbols.",
    "The trees in this part of the forest are all wrong. They’re growing in neat rows; they sway though there is no wind. Strange fruits swell in their boughs. You’ve stumbled into an orchard. Were those stones you stepped over a ways back someone’s fence?",
    "A boar bursts out of the undergrowth; foaming spittle flecks its tusks. It charges, eyes bloodshot, but makes no move to defend itself. All its attacks seem half-hearted. What drove this beast to seek death so?",
    "Cloying mist drifts into the region. You can barely see five paces ahead of you. Vague, bulbous forms can be seen protruding from the trees as you pass. Fungus. This isn’t mist, it’s spores.",
    "A fire shines through the trunks a little ways from you. Around it are adventurers, like you, camping for the night. None of them speak the same languages as you. The forest has them spooked, paranoid. They’ll welcome familiar company at first, but any number of things you do could set them off.",
    "A pond in a clearing, clean and still. No animal drinks from it, no insects buzz above it. No monsters will approach here beyond the tree line. Is it safe for you to stay here?",
    "The forest path is narrow and overgrown. Looking down the tunnel-like trail gives you vertigo and puts you off balance. Shadows appear to move and you feel like you’re just going in circles.",
    "The forest itself seems to be against your presence. Roots seem to spring up to trip you and branches swat at you when moved out of the way. The canopy closes around you shutting out the sunlight.",
    "The players hear footsteps echoing theirs, slightly behind, but the path is empty. Anything they call out is repeated back with missing syllables, as if the voice is in pain.",
    "A child’s laughter is heard off of the path, along with a flicker of light, which keeps appearing further away if the party follows. It leads them to the body of an elven boy with an arrow in his back.",
    "One member of the party hears the creaking of the trees and sounds of the forest suddenly stop, then a voice right behind them whispers their name on a hoarse voice, but there is no one there. None of the others notice anything different.",
    "The players hear the sounds of cries and screams from soldiers and the guttural cries of a nightmarish creature echo through the forest. The last one goes quiet before they reach them. If they choose to search, they find scattered around the ground the weather-worn skeletal remains of 16 soldiers from a long-dead empire known for it’s brutal methods, some of which are found ripped apart apparently trying to flee.",
    "The players feel as though something is watching them, but can’t see anything in the darkness. If they move more than 30ft in any direction they hear rustling following, but no matter how much they search cannot find anything.",
    "A dead character from one of the character’s past stands amongst the trees, with the appearance and wounds they had when they died. Only one person can see them. The character doesn’t move, but silently watches the player. Any attacks go through them without causing damage. They dissolve into a smoke-like darkness after 1d6 minutes.",
    "The sound of whispering is heard behind a bush. When it is pulled back or someone moves behind it, the whispering stops abruptly and a darkened feather falls slowly to the ground.",
    "A group of little girls are tied to the trees just off of the path, crying quietly. If the party goes to rescue them, they fight being rescued and attempt to escape and retie themselves to the trees, warning that ‘the Grogleman’ will come for them and their families too if they return home.",
    "A group of giants sit motionless around a giant chessboard, eyes intent on the pieces. Closer examination reveals the three are corpses; fungi grow from their eyelids and out of their hair, and the bodies slump and collapse if touched.",
    "The ground on both sides of the trail seems odd; upon closer examination, it is absolutely swarming with termites, covering the whole ground like a wave. If the party steps off the trail, the insects scatter from the party’s feet, leaving strange, momentary footprints in the ground.",
    "Prayers cannot be uttered aloud in the forest; spells can be cast as normal, but any verbal component comes out as a rattling hiss.",
    "A thick fog hovers over the ground, reaching up about two feet (to the chests of any halflings in the party, to the knees of humans). Anyone putting their heads in the fog (bending down to pick something up, etc.) hears muffled screams and far-off voices begging for their lives.",
    "Each person awakes to find a large meat hook carefully placed along on their bedrolls over their stomachs.",
    "In the periphery of the party’s vision, the trees that they pass seem to take on the image of a grim army, marching next to the party. When faced directly, the trees seem rather normal. The whole forest smells like a battlefield.",
    "Every time anyone lights a fire in the forest, there is a sudden hissing and smoking from the ground for twenty feet around the sparks. Little red lines appear like veins in the earth before fading to blackness.",
    "A monkey in a Jester’s costume comes swinging through the trees, hooting and screeching. If the adventurers catch the monkey, they find a bloody knife stuck in its belt. The monkey stares at them all with a baleful expression.",
    "Crows are screaming at each other as the party enters the woods. Increasingly, the screams sound like words, demanding blood.",
    "The hedge on the side of the trail has strange burn marks in it, almost exactly in the shape of men.",
    "A fox with a bloodied and broken leg comes limping up the path to the party and will pass by it if it can. If anyone speaks to it, the fox changes form into an old druidic woman, who mumbles about the forest being unsalvageable.",
    "As the party walks into the forest, they are greeted by an adventuring group coming the opposite direction. They chat for a little bit, explaining they found the woods too dangerous and are making their way back to whatever town the party has just come from. A little farther into the woods, the party finds the corpses of the same adventuring group, gathered around the sputtering embers of a fire…",
    "A bucket has been nailed to a tree, with a crude sign saying ‘Donations’ hanging under it. The bucket is half-filled with fingers and toes in varying levels of freshness.",
    "A small, neat signboard reads, ‘Please remain on the path.’ The neatness is somewhat marred by the corpses strewn below the sign.",
    "Someone has sharpened the branches around the trail in the forest, so that the trail is surrounded by sharp points.",
    "The party finds themselves staring at a strange tableaux- the corpse of a squirrel is placed next to an acorn, followed by (in order) the corpse of a cat, a dog, a wolf, and a bear. Behind the bear are strange scuffmarks in the dirt, like there was another corpse behind it, this one in the shape of something human…",
    "As the party walks through the forest, a strange figure suddenly drops from the trees in front of them- upon inspection, it is an effigy in the rough shape of a man, made of wooden boughs and leaves. This happens twice more as they walk. The fourth time, the figure drops down again, but anyone going to clear it away finds that it is actually the corpse of a man this time, with branches lashed to his limbs and a grisly smile on his face…",
    "A cold mist creeps into the surrounding area, players who breathe it will be asked to make a roll (perception, nature, etc.) but they’re making a constitution save with whatever modifier from the false roll. Anyone who rolls above a set DC inhales the mist and is subject to strange illusions.",
    "A hanged man rests on a lone tree. His pockets lined with petty change and a note that appears to be an apology letter to his family.",
    "For an hour of travel there’s no sound other than the party.",
    "A section of the forest has been frosted over in what appears to be a permanent winter. The center appears to have an unnatural cave of rocks that don’t match anything of the surrounding geological features. Inside features a drop that appears to be without end.",
    "A small portal opens up about 15 ft. above the party, expelling a blood lusted demon to the ground below. It bounces, stunned momentarily before it acquires a new target.",
    "A large head-sized knot in a tree resembles a human face. Wait! The eyes are real: wide, staring, terrified eyes! They look at you as you approach, flicking to each person that talks. But they cannot blink (so cannot communicate in that way), but constantly weep a watery sap.",
    "A large open area. The dirt seems fresher than the rest, no grass growing on the surface. The trees around the edge of the grove are burnt. In the middle sits (1d4) huge skulls, each at least 5 times the height of an average human. These skulls have gashes and claw marks in them, as well as huge spiraling or pointed horns. Scratched into the largest one is ‘entrance’ in infernal. If the player puts their ear to the ground and listens, they can faintly hear a low rumble that unnerves them to their very core and they don’t know why. Digging downwards could potentially reveal a connection between the material plain and one of the evil-aligned outer plains.",
    "The first character to awaken sees a grotesquely exaggerated face hovering inches from their own, glowing weakly with an internal light. An ear-to-ear grin splits the face, revealing a maw with three rows of serrated teeth. When the character blinks, the face disappears. It never appears again.",
    "The party comes across perfectly circle clearing. It’s barren waste, nothing ever grows there. Any flora the party might bring with them instantly wilts as it crosses the border. No animal, even as faithful as ranger’s companions, can be forced to cross into that circle. If the party decides to spend a night there, they will wake up outside the circle, with all their things scattered across the outer rim of the clearing. If they do it on the night of winter solstice, they will wake up in Avernus instead.",
    "The trees suddenly grow until the sun is blocked out and a magical darkness is cast from somewhere, and whenever the players talk, they hear their words repeated to them in their voice, but can’t tell where it’s coming from.",
    "The players slowly realize that they are on a loop in the forest. Every night they make camp, then wake up with supplies returned and make the exact same journey again. The players must find the source of this curse and free themselves.",
    "While the party makes camp, someone notices that there is an additional person around the fire. How did no one notice? Why does it smell like rotten meat? And why is it looking at the barbarian like that?",
    "In a less dense part of the forest, where moonlight pours through, the party witnesses a strange hulking creature (Mothman) perched on a tall tree. Its giant red eyes watch the party for a moment, before the creature flies away. The party sees the creature a few more times before coming to a large bridge built over a dangerous river. The creature appears one more time over head, just as the bridge collapses.",
    "After camping in the woods the party awakens to find the trees around them whipping and lashing as if buffeted by strong winds, though the party feels not even a faint breeze. Upon closer inspection, the party notices in mounting horror that the shadows cast by the trees are in the shape of human beings writhing in silent agony.",
    "The party comes across a 50ft circle of pitch-black darkness, with no logical reason as to its existence. Any players that cannot see when in such conditions hear whispers and chattering while in this area, and take 1d6 slashing damage for every round spent there. Any players that can see in such conditions (ex. darkvision) will not suffer any of these effects, and will see that nothing is attacking the others, but rather the wounds are manifesting onto them.",
    "You see corpses pinned to the sharpened boughs and branches of the tress around you, wood puncturing through their throats and sternums. The mottled moonlight filtering through the slowly swaying leaves gives them an eerie sense of motion. A sudden scampering and swish of branches punches through the soft rustling of the trees. Wherever you turn, the sound seems to be coming from behind you, getting closer and closer till you feel a hot, wet breath on the back of your neck. You swing around to confront the horror and see nothing but the corpses in the canopy, leering down at you like demonic piñatas.",
    "The party stumbles upon a clearing, with a post stamped into the ground. A message scrawled in Primordial reads about a treasure found in the hidden home of squirrels. With a few investigation checks, the party finds an odd tree. Around the back of the tree is a poorly hidden, though hidden, door. The door has no lock on it, but is not open; it has a feeling as though it is stuck. It can be forced open, or pried open, or cut open with fairly decent resistance. Inside is a staircase leading downward, lit by candles embedded in the tree that don’t seem like they’re burning the tree, though they are quite bright. After a 5-minute descent, the staircase ends in what appears to be a basement. The ceilings drip, and the room is damp and warm. (You can also narrate that the stairs are slippery, and have your players roll athletics not to slip). A decent perception roll can see that the floor and ceiling leak the warm water, without much of a source, while a really good perception check will notice that the color of the environment has become darker, and has a reddish tinge. Otherwise, there appears to be a library or study (whichever is easier for you to narrate.) There are no loose papers or pens and all of the books appear to be locked up, so that they cannot be taken out. A chest in the back can be found, a hair too conspicuously. Upon opening it, there is nothing inside but a pit, that smells of vomit and acid. With that, the room begins to shrink, slowly. The party should discover that they’re in the mouth of a giant mimic, who is swallowing them. Upon escaping, the entire tree uproots itself, spits and snarls at the players, and runs away. Best described if you can drop hints about descending the gullet of a beast, such as a hot draft, or distant gurgling.",
    "The party makes camp, and partway through the night, someone on watch starts to get an off feeling. Depending on perception rolls, they may or may not see the eyes watching from up in the trees, though they disappear just after being noticed. Additionally, they may hear the sound of leathery wings gliding through the air above them. Finally, after their defenses being lightly probed/tested, a creature attacks. (IIRC)I used a giant flying chupacabra from PF, but whatever works for you. The creature goes down relatively easily, but as it is struck down, it lets out a piercing scream. As quiet settles, the party hears answering cries from deeper in the woods",

There’s a sign on it that explains that a simple fortune is 1 silver, but a more intricate fortune is 1 gold. (If asked to prove her talent, she performs a simple druidcraft cantrip showing tomorrow’s weather and tells them to come back tomorrow to see her if she’s correct.

They offer the party a chance to buy their wares and show them the collection of arms and armor in the cart; all used, some very obviously, with dented armor, nicked blades and blood stains. There are a few good pieces and at a good price. If there are any magical items, the vendors are unaware of this and sell them as standard.

At your discretion the elf may have a wand or two up his sleeve in event of trouble.",

    "The party is making their way down a long and winding cavern passage when a stampede of small Underdark creatures as well as a few hook horrors rush past the players in the same direction that they're going. The reason for their terror becomes clear when a literal flood of Black Pudding crashes around the previous bend and begins rapidly making its way down the tunnel. At this point, the party enters a skill challenge, in which the goal is to outrun and somehow survive the oncoming deluge of ooze. Strength and Dexterity saving throws will be required to deal with the rocky obstacles filling the passageway and avoid the reaching pseudopods of the Black Pudding. Wisdom saving throws will also be needed when the passageway eventually splits off into separate paths of differing difficulties, which will happen at least once. After the party has successfully made a number of skill checks and saving throws appropriate to the size of the party, they will come across a large alcove in the cave wall that will hold the party safely out of reach until the Black Pudding passes by. Soon afterwards, it will flow down a passage leading even deeper into the earthy depths, leaving the surrounding passageways almost entirely devoid of life. By /u/ThePragmaticPimp",

The deep pixie will vanish immediately upon being seen and will spend the next few hours pulling pranks and gently harassing the party. If they put up with it good-naturedly, the pixie will eventually feel guilty and stop. The pixie will then reveal themselves once more and investigate the good intentions of the party before inviting the party back to a mushroom town of other deep pixies. There the pixies will ensure proper recompense for whatever trouble the original pixie caused.

Buried in the dirt is a seed (don't tell them this part unless they dig it up). The players need to replicate each season in order. How they do so is pretty open ended, so there's no \"You didn't do the exact thing, so it doesn't work.\" nonsense. As they correctly match each season, the paintings on the wall will light up and the room will physically change to match. The order for the correct solution is this: Spring: Rain. Party needs to pour some kind of liquid in the dirt. Water from canteens, prestidigitation, even taking a leak in the dirt would work. When completed, a small sprout will grow up from the dirt. Summer: Sun. Part needs to make any kind of light or heat. A daylight spell, firebolt (not cast directly at the plant), or lighting a torch would work. When completed, the sprout will grow into a miniature tree. Autumn: Wind. Party has to make some sort of air flow, even blowing at the tree would be acceptable. When completed, the leaves blow off the tree and it is bare. Winter: Snow. Any kind of cold magic will work, or any way to reduce the temperature around the tree. When completed a small cloud will form over the tree and snow and ice will cover it. After that, the doors to the room open, allowing the party to progress. By /u/SkrewtapeSecretary",

He is very friendly, welcoming the party inside and offering them food and water in exchange for stories. He tells them about his past as a Drow soldier when one day his patrol was slaughtered by hook horrors leaving him as the only survivor. He barely escaped, stumbling into this grove after a day or so travel while bleeding profusely. The grove's previous guardian, a Shield/Mountain Dwarf, found him in a pool of his own blood and nursed him back to health, all the while teaching him the secrets of nature and the ways of druid.

Trading for any of these items isn't done with coin, but with favours.. or for parts of the player's hair, skin, teeth, limbs, senses, etc etc. \"Eye for an eye\" sort of thing. Unbeknownst to the players, the mind-flayer has eaten 3 separate hags - whos combined mental forces of will have overcome the mind-flayer, and create a Hag Coven of 1. Plane Shifting to avoid confrontation is her speciality, the Hag Coven / Mind Flayer is more than a little genre savvy of the visage she now takes. By /u/pbsbqtf",

In reality, they are cowards and deserters, trying to make their way South.",
    "A man begs for help. He has been “robbed by bandits. Please, kind strangers, a ride into the village that’s just a day’s travel away?” At the earliest opportunity, he will attempt to steal something of value and ride away on your horse. If it seems like a good idea, he will stab you first.",

    "You come upon an impossibly elderly dwarf, naked as the day he was born, standing in the middle of the road demanding a 10 gp toll be paid. He wields a quarterstaff and proclaims himself to be the King of the Road. Thankfully, his long white beard shields his wrinkled nethers from your view.",

    "A ghost hovers in your path. He is Gregor Jantos. He asks you to deliver a message to his wife Alya in a nearby town: “It was no accident. Kelvar cut me open to get to you. Don’t trust him.” When you find Alya, she has been married to Kelvar for nine years and they have a daughter together. They are quite the happy family.

    "A twelve-year-old boy sits cross-legged atop a boulder that seems out of place near this stretch of road. He wears a circlet of rope around his head.

    "A traveling salesman blows past you on a cart. He is being chased by half a village who run after with axes and pitchforks. They claim he took advantage of them by selling them colored whiskey in a vial and saying it would cure Miner’s Fever. If you catch the salesman, he claims it’s honest work, selling people hope for an otherwise hopeless disease. He will give back 75% of the town’s money if you Intimidate him (DC 15). If you beat his Intimidate DC by 10 or more, he gives it all back.",
    "A patrol of royal guards is approaching. Six stout men, at least somewhat injured, guarding what seems to be an iron strongbox. They are traveling quickly. They say that they can tell right away that you are trustworthy folk, and they ask you to join them in transporting their incredibly valuable cargo to the King–which is several weeks travel out of your way–promising a small reward for the effort. Should you refuse, they again stress how incredibly valuable their cargo is, and explain that they are tired and weak from their journey, and vulnerable to bandits.

A third has a twisted and infected finger, rendering her unable to grasp anything. One wields a set of shears, one a sack of prepared flax fiber, and a third a distaff and spindle.

As you approach a bend in the road you hear two voices, each loudly complaining about the other. “You said you knew where we were going!” “I said that it was East, you’re the one who said a map was a waste of money!” A female Goliath sits on a fallen tree at the side of the road. A female Halfling is perched on her shoulders passing a wineskin to her companion.",
    "A seemingly normal looking man who greets the party on the road. He will mostly address the party member with the most magic jewelry.

    "A fortune teller sits on the side of the road in a cart that she seems to operate her business out of. There’s a sign on it that explains that a simple fortune is 1 silver, but a more intricate fortune is 1 gold. (If asked to prove her talent, she performs a simple druidcraft cantrip showing tomorrow’s weather and tells them to come back tomorrow to see her if she’s correct. This may be a good place for an insight check). If any party member gets a fortune told, the DM can choose the fortune, or she can foretell imminent death in their path.",

    "An elf and a dwarf on a cart pulled by a couple of oxen. Both wear expensive, gaudy clothes. The dwarf is puffing on a clay pipe and has an ornate repeating crossbow on his lap. They offer the party a chance to buy their wares and show them the collection of arms and armor in the cart; all used, some very obviously, with dented armor, nicked blades and blood stains. There are a few good pieces and at a good price. If there are any magical items, the vendors are unaware of this and sell them as standard. These characters make good money from looting battlefields, most of this haul from a recent clash between two nobles’ armies. At your discretion the elf may have a wand or two up his sleeve in event of trouble.",
    "A woman and six small children approach in an ox-drawn wagon. They appear dirty, tired and apprehensive, but if the party is friendly the mother will share her story: the father has run out on his family, and they could no longer afford to live in their previous home.

He has made a shop which he sells him magic for slightly lower prices that the Handbook’s. He will buy any rare magic for 110% of its actual cost. He buys magic at 90% of its actual cost.

For 5 gold pieces, he will stop his flower painting and spend time following the party painting a portrait of one of you until he is finished. If prompted about his work, he will get excited and show you his sketchbook. It’s full of various drawings and portraits of people he’s passed on the road. He says he never forgets a face and will even draw someone according to details given by you for 10 copper pieces. He’s surprisingly accurate even if you aren’t the best at describing things.",

    "The main road has been washed out. Crossing the gap would be dangerous and time consuming. There is an alternate route through the woods which are known to harbour a multitude of threats, but it’s faster than dealing with the washout.",
    "The party comes across a caravan in distress. Bandits have been known to set ambushes like this to catch unsuspecting travelers, but there are also rumours of a merchant caravan that’s late returning from the capitol. What do you do?",
    "A lost child wanders the road, heading back the way you came. It’s too late in the day to get back to town before nightfall, and you need to be in the next city over by morning.",
    "You see a dying man at the side of the road. If you stop, he tells you that [Person]’s guards attacked and robbed him. You are en route to an audience with [Person] to negotiate a lucrative commission, and as far as you know, s/he is a pillar of the community.",
    "A blizzard swirls up, impairing vision and forcing players to make con saves against cold damage.",

    "You are approached by a zealous group of cultists. They begin preaching to you that the world is going to about to be destroyed by the god they worship, and ask you if you’d like to join their end-of-the-world party (attending reveals that the world is not, in fact, about to end).",
    "While passing through an abandoned farm, you come across a scarecrow that psychically whispers to you. It gives the party an “impossible” riddle and claims that if you cannot answer then it will not let you pass.

    "The road comes to a large river. A new, high-quality bridge has been built over the river by a goblin clan who are seeking to overcome evil natures and to make an honest living. They are charging what is, in fact, a high if still fair fee.",
    "The path and map somehow did not mention a mountain that sits right in the middle of the road. The party did not notice the mountain until it was directly upon them.",
    "The village that you come to has just had adventurers a lot like your party come through, and have prepared an appropriate welcome. If your party are heroes, it might be fresh-baked bread. If your party is a bunch of jerk murder-hoboes, it might be tar and feathers.",
    "A large group of pigs are running every which way. A young girl in a ragged dress is trying to herd them together, sniffling slightly. If approached, she explains her father and mother are sick, but the pigs are supposed to be sold at the market, and they need the money for medicine.",
    "A worried-looking half-orc desperately tries to convince your party they are going the wrong way, and that they should take a similar (if slightly longer) trail to their destination. A religion check reveals that he is a cleric of a knowledge deity. If the party ignore him, he tries to convince them for a while, then shakes his head sadly and begins trudging away.",
    "A small stretch of woods are petrified in place and time, completely silent and perfectly still. Anyone touching anything but the path in the forest finds it hard as stone and completely immovable. There are birds and other animals in the forest, but they too are as still as statues.",

    "The road is completely blocked off as if an avalanche or rock slide occurred. Problem is the area is pretty flat and you don’t understand how the rocks got here.",
    "A group of animals have been killed and aligned in a strange formation with weird symbols drawn in blood. Party could find out this was used for a ritual of sorts.",
    "You turn a corner and the road ahead is blocked by a pool of lava. Upon inspection, there is no heat. Futher inspection will reveal it is a illusion spell. Perhaps a silly prank by a wizard. You can walk through the lava.",
    "As you make your way along the road, you come across a rotting dead animal carcass. The smell is horrid, but it is nothing out of the ordinary. As you continue, a few more animal carcasses are strewn across the road. More and more bodies begin to appear along the road the further you go. You eventually come face to face with a 20ft wall stacked full of bodies ranging from livestock, predatory animals, and even people. The wall blocks the road, and the only ways to proceed include scaling a nearby muddied-with-blood slope, backtracking to find another route, or digging through.",

    "You were sold bad travelling gear at your last stop – the rations are worthless, the water tainted, the leather goods falling apart.",
    "Flash Flood: A downpour upstream has triggered a flash flood over a low part of the road. Although the water is 3 feet deep, the current is so swift that it will without fail sweep away anyone trying to ford it. Individuals swept away face the risks of bludgeoning, impalement on debris, and drowning. By stepping in it at the shallower edge, it is obvious to even survival novices that it will be extremely dangerous to cross, especially towards the middle. The party can choose to wait it out if they like although it will take a long while.",

Then the illusion breaks – this Mirage Arcane made this deep cave look like a clear plains with a nice lovely stone path identical to the one you’ve been following. You are half a mile into this cave, and the fey who have lured you here do NOT want you to leave without doing something for them first.",
    "Modrons: Along the path you find a group of modrons (2 monodrones and a duodrone). These modrons were not given the return order during the last modron march (due to complications from becoming attacked) and are still trying to collect data. Upon noticing the party they harass them for data, doing things like surveying them and mesuring the size of their clothes while they are walking. They continue to do this until they either lose sight of the party or are destroyed.",
    "A fire can be seen just under a mile away in an obviously cultivated field, the wind now blows billows of smoke over the road the party is crossing.

    "Everyone the party asked in the last town/village/waypoint has said the only safe way to get through the valley is to take the blue path, detailed and maintained by both of the communities it is flanked by. The villagers all said the upkeep was mutual, and that they were on very good terms with the other town/village/waypoint.",
    "Upon getting out of the first town’s territory, they find the rest of the path barricaded and blocked, the barricade older and written in an archaic version of the prime language. The trees and animals all look like they are from a different time. There is a ‘detour’ path but it’s filled with primeval dangers.",
    "While traveling the carriage you are riding on hits a rather large bump causing an already weak axel to snap rendering the carriage useless. The party must either find a way to fix the snapped wood so that they continue, or they can try and convince another traveler to help.",
    "You find the rats have gotten into your rations. You’ll either need to make constitution saving throws or find new food.",
    "A massive and extremely powerful dragon ambushes you somewhere along your journey through a massively dense and vast forest. It is strong enough to slaughter you all without trying, and is upset that you are not aware of it. Gonna have to talk fast to appease it. It also desires a rare food item you possess, and will allow you to pass if you offer it the food and an appeal to its vanity.",

    "There’s been an earthquake, and the pathway is blocked by something. It might be a fallen tree, a crack in the ground, or a piece of land that broke off a mountainside. Either way, it’s going to be difficult to get past it and nigh-impossible to get a cart across.",

    "Dimensional Instability – There’s been a small ripple in the planar fabric between worlds. For a few moments, another plane is open. It might be the Elemental Plane of Fire, the Feywild, the Shadowfell, the Astral Plane, or even one of the realms of the gods.",
    "Mystic Orchard – A large area filled with various trees and bushes, each one covered with different fruits. Food is plentiful, but some of the assorted berries might be poisonous or have a side-effect.",
    "Overgrowth – The path is overgrown with vines, grasses, and tree roots. It is difficult terrain to move past, and will take twice as long to cross.",
    "Oh look, it’s a giant stag. Roll 2d4. 2-4 means the stag charges. 5-7 means it looks at your party and moves on. 8 means it bows before you, granting your party a 2-point Charisma Bonus for the next week.",
    "A felled tree blocks your path, and the way around is blocked by dense overgrowth.",
    "You come across a large battlefield of some previous encounter with hundreds of bodies laying strewn across the ground and piles of corpses heaped into stinking mounds, crossing around will take a full day but if they cross through they need to make a Constitution save DC 15 or become sickened with rot from fly bites carrying disease which gives the poisoned status for 24 hours.",

    "Part of the path has been washed away leaving a large, deep mud puddle that is difficult to traverse around with the wagon/cart because of the dense bush either side. If the party chooses to forge through it takes them 2d20 minutes, and they end up covered in the thick, sticky, foul smelling mud. If the party chooses to clear a path to the side it takes them 3d20 minutes.",
    "You notice an abundance of sink holes in the field. Players bust be careful with their footing as well as not grouping up to close together.",

Along the sides of the road are statues of confused, frightened animals made from random rocks and minerals. All organic life in the area slowly begins transforming into various rocks and minerals over the course of one full day, at which point the organisms are petrified.

Upon leaving the stretch of the road, any partially petrified creatures have the transformation process occur in reverse at the same rate.",

    "A large, deep depression in the ground that appears to be covered in smooth, gray-black glass. If one slips and falls in, it is very difficult to get out.

    "A deep fog rolls in faster and thicker than one would think is natural. All rolls related to navigation or investigation based on the terrain have disadvantage.",
    "The party is set upon by a group of bandits, ferociously attacking them with abandon. Suspiciously, they do not yell or even speak. DC 10 to notice their mouths have been sewn shut and their eyes look wild with panic, as if their actions are not their own.",
    "A lone child that refuses to talk but will hold one of the adventures hands, and theirs alone (normally while sucking her thumb). If the child feels threatened, she will run away from the party and they won’t be able to find her again. There are no tracks. (Optional: If they look after her for a night, she will leave them a gift.)",
    "A dog with a fancy collar appears to lead the party to an area of disturbed dirt and begins to dig it up. Upon closer inspection the party finds the body of a small girl holding a leash that looks quiet similar to the dogs collar. When they turn to examine the dog, he is nowhere to be found.",
    "Cats appear to be watching the party from the trees. Dozens upon dozens of them. Whenever a member of the party approaches them they run away and can’t be found (may serve as lookouts for a darker force).",
    "While camped for the night, the party’s extinguished campfire relights to a full blaze. The second the party member on watch looks at the fire, it extinguishes completely. The only sign that the mysterious fire ever existed is a faint smell of burning twigs.",
    "Deep in the forest, approaching dusk, the party finds a logging camp. Several small cabins and a mill. Smoke curls lazily up from one or two of the chimneys. There is nobody in the camp. There are plates of food on tables, still warm. Clothes on a washing line are still damp. Only the doors into the mill are locked. As night falls, a fierce storm begins to build, and from the mill the saws can be heard rasping back and forth, though they don’t sound quite right…",
    "The party finds a scraggly, disheveled child apparently lost in the forest. It asks the party for help, should the party agree, they come under the effects of a curse until they defeat the child (Actually a restless Evil) who flees, attempting to lead them into a hazard deeper in the forest.",
    "Small dolls sit in a tree the players pass by. They are wearing crude clothes, and don sticks of specific lengths. Poor perception rolls feel anonymous sets of eyes gazing at you, while good perception rolls can discover them. These dolls, if ignored, will appear again in a different tree a few feet up, requiring lower rolls as they subtly make themselves more obvious. Upon the first investigation, you find that the dolls are poorly stitched together, with leaves still poking out of the burlap fabric, and expressionless faces with small stones as eyes. However, with each successive perception roll as the party walks away, the dolls become slightly more realistic. On additional rolls their rock-eyes appear to follow you (Mona Lisa style), their skin becomes taut and leathery, and their clothes become more realistic. Repeat as necessary, with the players unable to leave a small section of the forest (due to magical barriers, or because walking straight forward keeps leading them back to the same spots.) Eventually, all of the dolls should clearly resemble everyone in the party. It is important that the dolls never appear to move on their own, and in every way act as though an inanimate object would. They can be destroyed, ripped, held, carried, etc. There should also be at least 4 separate perception checks on the dolls IMO. It really draws the frustration out, and that is an expression of fear. The final perception check on the dolls will have the dolls be very hard to find, except by one person, who you can choose beforehand. No matter how well other party members roll, the person you choose will feel a tingling on the back of their neck, and turn around to find the dolls in a high branch. They are nearly perfect mimics of the party, and are standing around the doll that looks like the person who discovered them, whose doll has a thick piece of string around their neck. The person feels paralyzed as the can only just watch due to fear, as time slows around them. The doll-party gazes directly into the player characters real eyes, and gently… pushes. For extra effect, have a pencil ready to snap upon this moment. Sometimes the cheesy sound effect speaks volumes more than words. The party will usually react at this point, let them destroy the dolls. It’s cathartic. If you want to continue the fear though, every one in a while later on, let them see a flicker of movement out of the corner of their eyes. Bonus points if you pick a grunge or mistake to build this off of. Like if a cleric forgets to heal a fighter and the fighter calls, have one of them be the one that pushes the other off, as though the cleric purposely didn’t heal, or the fighter was trying to get revenge. If the party has a rogue, have their doll slip a stick in the back of the hanged on. There’s a ton of customization you can do, and if done well, you can seed a lot of discord between two player characters and build their relationship to be really dynamic. Happy Creepy Crawlies.",
    "After spending more and more time in the forest, the players start to notice the trees have grown faces. It’s unknown if this is just them going crazy, or if it’s real.",
    "As the party sets down for camp they hear a muttering in the shrubs and then creeping out from it they behold a Gibbering Mouther, each eye and mouth seemingly drawn from a different creature, without repetition. Just before their skin and brains begin to itch, each party member realizes they do not recognize any of their kind yet among its monstrous morphology…",
    "As the night lengthens, from the shadows surrounding the campfire, come the light chiming sounds of children’s laughter. The laughter gets louder as the flames fall to coals.",
    "The wood you gathered for the night is not enough to keep the flames high all night and the sounds are deeper from the dark woods.",
    "A sweet glade, dappled with sunlight and shadows provide a relief from the previous heat and humidity. A gentle brook flows along one edge and gurgled merrily. Several fruit trees sit in the center and lay heavily with ripe fruits. Flowers fragrant the air and a gentle breeze cool the glen, sweetening the air and cooling the weary traveler. An old body hangs from a limb of the tree, but upon inspection it appears obvious they could have stood and not strangled.",
    "You come across an alter, freshly used and dripping with blood. Meat has been portioned and set out for something.",
    "An open clearing shows the remains of several bodies arranged in a glyph like patter. Due to dismemberment and missing pieces you are not sure how many bodies were used. As you review the scene, the trail behind you vanishes and leaves naught but deep and ancient thorn bushes, redolent with the faint reek of decaying flesh.",
    "A medium sized hut made of gingerbread and various pieces of candy. A kindly old woman asks you in for dinner.",
    "A pile of shit with human clothes, hair and bones in.",
    "The party find a clearing with an odd nature alter in the center. While they are distracted, the trees around them move closer. If they are distracted for long enough, the trees form a complete wall. The trees do not attack; they only defend themselves if attacked.",
    "There is a tree with deep scratches in it, as if it has been attacked by a dagger. Upon inspection, the player discovers old, dried blood embedded in the bark and writing in a deep red color that says ‘Find me, help me’ (illusory script). As the party continues they see more trees of a similar nature, and eventually find a crazed gnome who is determined to eat party members in order to restore his youth.",
    "The path opens into a clearing. Near the center is a unicorn lying down on its side. It looks serene and peaceful. The clearing is bright and quiet. Almost silent but for distant birdsong. If the party approach they realize it is dying. Its throat is torn open by some powerful beast and the wound looks infected or poisoned. The edges of the clearing are creeping in, going brown or fungus laden and choked with weeds and branches, which seem to close in whenever no one is looking in that direction. The unicorn is probably (?) past any help the party can give but may last an hour. Left to its own devices, the clearing will close in maybe 20 minutes.",
    "The trees appear to be leaning closer together and are a different shade of green to normal trees. As a breeze blows they seem to be whispering to each other wisha…wisha…wisha",
    "The undergrowth is thick confining you to a narrow path. It switched sharply left then right…. to a dead end. Turning back it is a dead end that way. The only way forward is to hack through the lower branches and scrub. As the players do, the cut stems ooze blood. If burned instead the wet plants hiss and whistle as they burn sounding like tortured screams.",
    "You begin to notice that everything looks familiar. Slowly it dawns on you that the trees are all identical, right down to that twig that snapped off when it caught on you backpack.",
    "A family of forest giants has caught the scent of the party while hunting. They’re catching up.",
    "Disembodied screams echo around you. Ghosts of the past? Or maybe it’s Jim the halfling rogue, trying to scare off tourists so he can start a coalmine?",
    "In the distance you see a light. When you get closer you see a lamp hanging from a tree swinging in the wind. It is full of oil but there are no signs of whoever put the lamp there.",
    "You find humanoid skeletons tied together to form the rough shape of a horse. If you use speak with dead on it, it only screams.",
    "You suddenly realize that all the noise in the forest is gone. As if silence had been cast but you can still talk and make noise as normal. Suddenly the forest is filled with howls, screeches, and buzzing so loud it deafens the party. When the party can hear again the forest is back to normal.",
    "You come across a cottage in the woods belonging to a friendly woodsman and his wife. They provide food and shelter for the night. When the party awakes they are in the burned down ruins of a cottage with the skeletal remains of the farmer and his wife reaching desperately for the party.",
    "A hooded figure sits on a stump. He does not respond to anything. If you attack or touch the figure they collapse into a swarm of spiders.",
    "A parrot is found on a branch repeating the words ‘Gods what is that?!’",
    "The party finds a wanted poster tacked to a tree with a group shot of the party with a red X marked through two of the party members faces. The party does not remember posing for this picture nor know why they would be wanted.",
    "You come upon a dry riverbed. From the trees lining the banks dangle a hundred mutilated corpses.",
    "Two children play fight with sticks, laughing and taunting each other. When they notice the party watching, they’ll happily put on a show. That’s when the other children emerge from the trees, only they aren’t playing and they’ve got more than just sticks and stones.",
    "A strangely inviting cave comes in to view. Surely it’s some kind of den and we shouldn’t go in but I just… cant…. help it.",
    "From deep within the forest loud clicking and chattering noises of various pitches and tempo can be heard. Upon inspection a small city raiding party dressed in armor have been brutally mutilated with heads twisted round and limbs ripped off. The same clicking noise starts again and gets closer and louder. When it seems like the creature is on top of them it suddenly stops and does not reappear.",
    "It has been at least 24 hours since sunset and it has yet to come back up. What’s worse is that all the forest chatter from insects and wildlife has trickled nearly to a standstill save for one slow but consistent crunching that has been following at a distance for hours now. Are the stars even moving anymore?",
    "Early in the day the party passes underneath a suit of armor suspended in the trees, branches occupying the inside of the suit as if they had squeezed out the body that occupied it before. Branches sprout from the facemask wildly, limbs protrude from the leg and armholes, and the entire chest piece is nearly bursting from the volume of foliage it contains.",
    "Just when its time to make camp for the night yet again within the damp cold forest, the party comes across an old house sitting unoccupied in a small clearing. They seek comfort in the house, building a fire in the hearth and drinking some old booze left by previous tenants. Keeping good watch, they peer out the windows frequently. Maybe it’s just the old wine but are the trees…. getting closer?",
    "A few chickens are pecking at the dirt in the middle of the trail. When you come upon them, you spook them, and they trot off into the forest a few meters. They resume pecking; but little does anyone know that they’ve begun to peck seeds that have the effect of the enlarge spell. Treat an enlarged chicken as an allosaurus and let the fun begin.",
    "Glowing eyes stare out of a knothole in an old and gnarled tree. When the players notice it watching, the thing scampers deeper into the tree. If they investigate the knothole they’ll find it goes deep, deeper than the tree itself. At the bottom of the hole something glitters. Gold? Many more glowing eyes stare up around it.",
    "A corpse sways in the branches of a lonely willow by a stream, dangling from a noose. The corpse is grinning, and dancing a slow, merry jig.",
    "Something howls in the distance. Another something responds. Not wolves. The howls are too ragged, sound too much like words.",
    "A little twig-and-twine doll is pinned to a branch up ahead. Another just like it can be seen just off the path, and another beyond that one. Even in the depths of the woods you’ll be protected so long as you follow them. Your safety once you arrive where they’re leading you is less guaranteed. A polite invitation has been extended. It won’t come again.",
    "Moaning can be heard from a bush. Within is a hunter, near-death, near incoherent from fear. No mere animal could have inflicted the wounds he bears. They’re too precise, suggestive of strange symbols.",
    "The trees in this part of the forest are all wrong. They’re growing in neat rows; they sway though there is no wind. Strange fruits swell in their boughs. You’ve stumbled into an orchard. Were those stones you stepped over a ways back someone’s fence?",
    "A boar bursts out of the undergrowth; foaming spittle flecks its tusks. It charges, eyes bloodshot, but makes no move to defend itself. All its attacks seem half-hearted. What drove this beast to seek death so?",
    "Cloying mist drifts into the region. You can barely see five paces ahead of you. Vague, bulbous forms can be seen protruding from the trees as you pass. Fungus. This isn’t mist, it’s spores.",
    "A fire shines through the trunks a little ways from you. Around it are adventurers, like you, camping for the night. None of them speak the same languages as you. The forest has them spooked, paranoid. They’ll welcome familiar company at first, but any number of things you do could set them off.",
    "A pond in a clearing, clean and still. No animal drinks from it, no insects buzz above it. No monsters will approach here beyond the tree line. Is it safe for you to stay here?",
    "The forest path is narrow and overgrown. Looking down the tunnel-like trail gives you vertigo and puts you off balance. Shadows appear to move and you feel like you’re just going in circles.",
    "The forest itself seems to be against your presence. Roots seem to spring up to trip you and branches swat at you when moved out of the way. The canopy closes around you shutting out the sunlight.",
    "The players hear footsteps echoing theirs, slightly behind, but the path is empty. Anything they call out is repeated back with missing syllables, as if the voice is in pain.",
    "A child’s laughter is heard off of the path, along with a flicker of light, which keeps appearing further away if the party follows. It leads them to the body of an elven boy with an arrow in his back.",
    "One member of the party hears the creaking of the trees and sounds of the forest suddenly stop, then a voice right behind them whispers their name on a hoarse voice, but there is no one there. None of the others notice anything different.",
    "The players hear the sounds of cries and screams from soldiers and the guttural cries of a nightmarish creature echo through the forest. The last one goes quiet before they reach them. If they choose to search, they find scattered around the ground the weather-worn skeletal remains of 16 soldiers from a long-dead empire known for it’s brutal methods, some of which are found ripped apart apparently trying to flee.",
    "The players feel as though something is watching them, but can’t see anything in the darkness. If they move more than 30ft in any direction they hear rustling following, but no matter how much they search cannot find anything.",
    "A dead character from one of the character’s past stands amongst the trees, with the appearance and wounds they had when they died. Only one person can see them. The character doesn’t move, but silently watches the player. Any attacks go through them without causing damage. They dissolve into a smoke-like darkness after 1d6 minutes.",
    "The sound of whispering is heard behind a bush. When it is pulled back or someone moves behind it, the whispering stops abruptly and a darkened feather falls slowly to the ground.",
    "A group of little girls are tied to the trees just off of the path, crying quietly. If the party goes to rescue them, they fight being rescued and attempt to escape and retie themselves to the trees, warning that ‘the Grogleman’ will come for them and their families too if they return home.",
    "A group of giants sit motionless around a giant chessboard, eyes intent on the pieces. Closer examination reveals the three are corpses; fungi grow from their eyelids and out of their hair, and the bodies slump and collapse if touched.",
    "The ground on both sides of the trail seems odd; upon closer examination, it is absolutely swarming with termites, covering the whole ground like a wave. If the party steps off the trail, the insects scatter from the party’s feet, leaving strange, momentary footprints in the ground.",
    "Prayers cannot be uttered aloud in the forest; spells can be cast as normal, but any verbal component comes out as a rattling hiss.",
    "A thick fog hovers over the ground, reaching up about two feet (to the chests of any halflings in the party, to the knees of humans). Anyone putting their heads in the fog (bending down to pick something up, etc.) hears muffled screams and far-off voices begging for their lives.",
    "Each person awakes to find a large meat hook carefully placed along on their bedrolls over their stomachs.",
    "In the periphery of the party’s vision, the trees that they pass seem to take on the image of a grim army, marching next to the party. When faced directly, the trees seem rather normal. The whole forest smells like a battlefield.",
    "Every time anyone lights a fire in the forest, there is a sudden hissing and smoking from the ground for twenty feet around the sparks. Little red lines appear like veins in the earth before fading to blackness.",
    "A monkey in a Jester’s costume comes swinging through the trees, hooting and screeching. If the adventurers catch the monkey, they find a bloody knife stuck in its belt. The monkey stares at them all with a baleful expression.",
    "Crows are screaming at each other as the party enters the woods. Increasingly, the screams sound like words, demanding blood.",
    "The hedge on the side of the trail has strange burn marks in it, almost exactly in the shape of men.",
    "A fox with a bloodied and broken leg comes limping up the path to the party and will pass by it if it can. If anyone speaks to it, the fox changes form into an old druidic woman, who mumbles about the forest being unsalvageable.",
    "As the party walks into the forest, they are greeted by an adventuring group coming the opposite direction. They chat for a little bit, explaining they found the woods too dangerous and are making their way back to whatever town the party has just come from. A little farther into the woods, the party finds the corpses of the same adventuring group, gathered around the sputtering embers of a fire…",
    "A bucket has been nailed to a tree, with a crude sign saying ‘Donations’ hanging under it. The bucket is half-filled with fingers and toes in varying levels of freshness.",
    "A small, neat signboard reads, ‘Please remain on the path.’ The neatness is somewhat marred by the corpses strewn below the sign.",
    "Someone has sharpened the branches around the trail in the forest, so that the trail is surrounded by sharp points.",
    "The party finds themselves staring at a strange tableaux- the corpse of a squirrel is placed next to an acorn, followed by (in order) the corpse of a cat, a dog, a wolf, and a bear. Behind the bear are strange scuffmarks in the dirt, like there was another corpse behind it, this one in the shape of something human…",
    "As the party walks through the forest, a strange figure suddenly drops from the trees in front of them- upon inspection, it is an effigy in the rough shape of a man, made of wooden boughs and leaves. This happens twice more as they walk. The fourth time, the figure drops down again, but anyone going to clear it away finds that it is actually the corpse of a man this time, with branches lashed to his limbs and a grisly smile on his face…",
    "A cold mist creeps into the surrounding area, players who breathe it will be asked to make a roll (perception, nature, etc.) but they’re making a constitution save with whatever modifier from the false roll. Anyone who rolls above a set DC inhales the mist and is subject to strange illusions.",
    "A hanged man rests on a lone tree. His pockets lined with petty change and a note that appears to be an apology letter to his family.",
    "For an hour of travel there’s no sound other than the party.",
    "A section of the forest has been frosted over in what appears to be a permanent winter. The center appears to have an unnatural cave of rocks that don’t match anything of the surrounding geological features. Inside features a drop that appears to be without end.",
    "A small portal opens up about 15 ft. above the party, expelling a blood lusted demon to the ground below. It bounces, stunned momentarily before it acquires a new target.",
    "A large head-sized knot in a tree resembles a human face. Wait! The eyes are real: wide, staring, terrified eyes! They look at you as you approach, flicking to each person that talks. But they cannot blink (so cannot communicate in that way), but constantly weep a watery sap.",
    "A large open area. The dirt seems fresher than the rest, no grass growing on the surface. The trees around the edge of the grove are burnt. In the middle sits (1d4) huge skulls, each at least 5 times the height of an average human. These skulls have gashes and claw marks in them, as well as huge spiraling or pointed horns. Scratched into the largest one is ‘entrance’ in infernal. If the player puts their ear to the ground and listens, they can faintly hear a low rumble that unnerves them to their very core and they don’t know why. Digging downwards could potentially reveal a connection between the material plain and one of the evil-aligned outer plains.",
    "The first character to awaken sees a grotesquely exaggerated face hovering inches from their own, glowing weakly with an internal light. An ear-to-ear grin splits the face, revealing a maw with three rows of serrated teeth. When the character blinks, the face disappears. It never appears again.",
    "The party comes across perfectly circle clearing. It’s barren waste, nothing ever grows there. Any flora the party might bring with them instantly wilts as it crosses the border. No animal, even as faithful as ranger’s companions, can be forced to cross into that circle. If the party decides to spend a night there, they will wake up outside the circle, with all their things scattered across the outer rim of the clearing. If they do it on the night of winter solstice, they will wake up in Avernus instead.",
    "The trees suddenly grow until the sun is blocked out and a magical darkness is cast from somewhere, and whenever the players talk, they hear their words repeated to them in their voice, but can’t tell where it’s coming from.",
    "The players slowly realize that they are on a loop in the forest. Every night they make camp, then wake up with supplies returned and make the exact same journey again. The players must find the source of this curse and free themselves.",
    "While the party makes camp, someone notices that there is an additional person around the fire. How did no one notice? Why does it smell like rotten meat? And why is it looking at the barbarian like that?",
    "In a less dense part of the forest, where moonlight pours through, the party witnesses a strange hulking creature (Mothman) perched on a tall tree. Its giant red eyes watch the party for a moment, before the creature flies away. The party sees the creature a few more times before coming to a large bridge built over a dangerous river. The creature appears one more time over head, just as the bridge collapses.",
    "After camping in the woods the party awakens to find the trees around them whipping and lashing as if buffeted by strong winds, though the party feels not even a faint breeze. Upon closer inspection, the party notices in mounting horror that the shadows cast by the trees are in the shape of human beings writhing in silent agony.",
    "The party comes across a 50ft circle of pitch-black darkness, with no logical reason as to its existence. Any players that cannot see when in such conditions hear whispers and chattering while in this area, and take 1d6 slashing damage for every round spent there. Any players that can see in such conditions (ex. darkvision) will not suffer any of these effects, and will see that nothing is attacking the others, but rather the wounds are manifesting onto them.",
    "You see corpses pinned to the sharpened boughs and branches of the tress around you, wood puncturing through their throats and sternums. The mottled moonlight filtering through the slowly swaying leaves gives them an eerie sense of motion. A sudden scampering and swish of branches punches through the soft rustling of the trees. Wherever you turn, the sound seems to be coming from behind you, getting closer and closer till you feel a hot, wet breath on the back of your neck. You swing around to confront the horror and see nothing but the corpses in the canopy, leering down at you like demonic piñatas.",
    "The party stumbles upon a clearing, with a post stamped into the ground. A message scrawled in Primordial reads about a treasure found in the hidden home of squirrels. With a few investigation checks, the party finds an odd tree. Around the back of the tree is a poorly hidden, though hidden, door. The door has no lock on it, but is not open; it has a feeling as though it is stuck. It can be forced open, or pried open, or cut open with fairly decent resistance. Inside is a staircase leading downward, lit by candles embedded in the tree that don’t seem like they’re burning the tree, though they are quite bright. After a 5-minute descent, the staircase ends in what appears to be a basement. The ceilings drip, and the room is damp and warm. (You can also narrate that the stairs are slippery, and have your players roll athletics not to slip). A decent perception roll can see that the floor and ceiling leak the warm water, without much of a source, while a really good perception check will notice that the color of the environment has become darker, and has a reddish tinge. Otherwise, there appears to be a library or study (whichever is easier for you to narrate.) There are no loose papers or pens and all of the books appear to be locked up, so that they cannot be taken out. A chest in the back can be found, a hair too conspicuously. Upon opening it, there is nothing inside but a pit, that smells of vomit and acid. With that, the room begins to shrink, slowly. The party should discover that they’re in the mouth of a giant mimic, who is swallowing them. Upon escaping, the entire tree uproots itself, spits and snarls at the players, and runs away. Best described if you can drop hints about descending the gullet of a beast, such as a hot draft, or distant gurgling.",
    "The party makes camp, and partway through the night, someone on watch starts to get an off feeling. Depending on perception rolls, they may or may not see the eyes watching from up in the trees, though they disappear just after being noticed. Additionally, they may hear the sound of leathery wings gliding through the air above them. Finally, after their defenses being lightly probed/tested, a creature attacks. (IIRC)I used a giant flying chupacabra from PF, but whatever works for you. The creature goes down relatively easily, but as it is struck down, it lets out a piercing scream. As quiet settles, the party hears answering cries from deeper in the woods.",
